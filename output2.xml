<from>Senator <person refersto="hansard">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President, when this debate was adjourned yesterday, I was dealing with the speech of the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs concerning particularly the part that the hon. the Minister of Finance had played in the Information scandal.</p>
<p>The hon. the Minister of Finance has stomped backwards and forwards between the Senate and the Other Place, and has stomped from platform to platform outside this Parliament, complaining bitterly about lies and untruths and the unjust allegations that have been made against him. I think the time has come to point out to the hon. the Minister that he has his recourse, both in this place and outside, and he knows what it is. I think the time has come for him to stop his threats and allegations and to do something about it.</p>

<p>If the hon. the Minister believes that I have slandered him, he knows what his recourse is. He has a recourse and the voting power to carry it out. That is why I said to him the other day that the time had come for him to put his courage where his mouth is. Let us stop the threats and all the other things that are happening. I believe that his political career is ruined anyway and that he is finished.</p>

<p>Whether he is English speaking or Afrikaans-speaking makes no difference. When the hon. the Minister says that his hands are clean, that has not been at issue either. On two previous occasions I made it quite clear that there is no allegation against him that he put his hands in the till, that he filled his hind-pocket or whatever one might think. There is no question of that at all. We have not questioned his integrity in that regard. But I think we must get the facts straight.</p>

<from>Senator <person refersto="hansard">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>
<p>Thank you, Sir. There is no doubt that there was collusion between the then Prime Minister, Mr. John Vorster, the then Minister of Information, Dr. Connie Mulder, and the then Minister of Finance, the late Dr. Diederichs. There was collusion among those three to use public funds in a manner other than that for which they had been budgeted. The hon. the Minister of Defence, the present Prime Minister, Mr. P. W. Botha, found himself involved in this, unwillingly, and we accept that. When Senator Owen Horwood became Minister of Finance he found himself in a situation which he had inherited. Of the triumvirate who were involved in this affair, he is the only one left whom we can talk to in this place.</p>

<p>Involved in what?</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#webber">
<from>Senator <person refersto="hansard">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>
<p>In the illegal transfer of money out of which arose the misappropriation and out of which arose the wrongful use of public money for party political purposes. He was involved in it, and then he wonders why we attack him! He says it is a personal vendetta, but I feel that those facts must be pointed out to this House. It is not a question of a personal vendetta. It could have been anybody on those benches who happened to fill that seat. He is the only one left and represents the whole illegal arrangement. That is why he happens to be the person who is attacked. He is attacked as a Minister of Finance and not in his personal capacity. It is, therefore, not a personal vendetta as he claims it to be.</p>
<p>The hon. the Minister has only himself to blame for the contradictory and conflicting statements which have been made. These have been pointed out repeatedly and I do not have to repeat them again in this place. I want now to say the last word that I intend saying on this sorry episode, at least until after the final report of the Erasmus Commission has been received.</p>

<p>Thank you, Sir. I am concerned with the political responsibility of that hon. Minister, and his political responsibility is what we deal with here. The commission will come out with the facts.

<from>The <person refersto="hansard">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>
<p>What a performance up till now!</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#webber">
<from>Senator <person refersto="hansard">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>
<p>Really, Mr. President, I do not know why the hon. the Minister is so sensitive about this thing. Do you wonder why we are so suspicious when he is so sensitive?</p>
<p>The hon. the Minister in his budget has made concessions totalling near R1 000 million, and, Sir, he has presented what I want to call a delayed action budget. Those concessions totalling nearly R1 000 million are spread over a year and, in fact, most people will only feel the benefit of them at the end of the year. This budget is clearly stimulatory and as such it has been welcomed, but I am afraid that the benefit of many of these stimulatory measures which he has taken is going to be negated by Government action, by the Government’s failure to contain and control the inflation rate prevailing at the moment.</p>
<p>When we realize that from March 1978 to March 1979 the inflation rate was in excess of 12%, then we must know what we were dealing with at the time of the budget’s presentation. What has happened since then? This is what I would like to talk to the Government and the hon. the Minister about this afternoon. I believe that the increases and particularly the increases in administered prices—the prices of administered products— are going to negate completely any concessions which the hon. the Minister may have made in his budget.</p>
<p>Let us start with the question of eggs which is topical at the moment. In this case I believe that there is a responsibility resting upon the Government at the moment to take drastic action as soon as possible. It is unfortunate that the hon. the Minister of Agriculture has not been able to attend this afternoon. It is not his fault; I concede that; but it would have been nice to have him here and I sincerely hope that the hon. the Minister or somebody will convey the message to him.</p>
<p>The time has come for him to make an investigation of Nepco, the egg producers’ co-operative which has been formed. I am wholly in favour of the co-operative marketing of agricultural products, but I am not in favour of the use of the co-operative system to create a monopoly. Co-operatives should operate on a regional basis and not on a national basis where they create a monopoly and where they, then, Sir, are able to dictate not only to the consumers but to the producers as well. They have arbitrarily decided to increase the price of eggs. We were told originally that it was going to be 8 cents per dozen; then we were told it was going to be 4 cents per dozen. Now it is rumoured there will be no increase. We do not know. The operative date is 14 May when those who are in business will receive their eggs and will only know then what the new price is going to be.</p>
<p>At the moment Nepco is charging retailers 57 cents a dozen for large eggs, and 60 cents a dozen for extra large eggs, and these are being retailed at a fair price in the chain stores and supermarkets at 66 cents and 70 cents a dozen respectively, plus 3 cents for sales tax. I believe they are discounting to the chains at a cost of 56 cents and 59 cents, respectively, for large and extra large eggs. But, Sir, there is still a surplus, and they have decided, notwithstanding the massive surplus of eggs, to increase the prices. I would like to demand of the hon. the Minister of Agriculture today, or the hon. the Minister of Finance, who also has the power, to do something about freezing the price of eggs before the increase is made. I do not believe the Government can wait until after the price is increased before they take action to freeze.</p>
<p>Why do I say this, Sir? Because we have the situation where we have a surplus of eggs which is costing the country nearly R9 million to export at a loss. Those eggs are bought in from the producers at plus-minus 40 cents a dozen—28 cents a kilo is the price paid by the Egg Board for those surplus eggs. Now, of course, Nepco is reported to have compelled a producer who had surplus eggs which he was unable to sell at a price of between 56 cents and 59 cents a dozen, to hand them over to Nepco to pass on to the board at 40 cents a dozen, whereas he wished to dispose of his surplus eggs in the Black rural areas. But he was forbidden to do so by Nepco. This is where the absolute power of such a national co-operative becomes immoral and where it is incorrect. It has the power to stop that producer from selling his eggs at a reduced price which I believe it is doing. I believe the hon. the Minister should look into that aspect as well and stop it right away.</p>
<p>I believe that the hon. the Minister should have this inquiry made right away but at the same time I believe that the hon. the Minister of Agriculture has the solution to the problem in his hands. Some time ago the hon. the Minister piloted a Bill through this House which allowed him to control the number of laying hens. He applied that Act for some years and then he stopped doing so. Administratively he has not applied the Act and that is the reason we have a surplus of eggs today.</p>
<p>I believe that the blame for that must be placed at the door of the hon. the Minister for having allowed these people to collect more and more hens. He has also allowed a scheme under which producers are allowed to produce without looking for a market and simply dump their eggs on the board. The housewives have in consequence to pay 4 cents per dozen in the form of a levy for the eggs they purchase today. Eggs are being exported at a loss today, Sir, while Nepco, the co-operative society that is supposed to be looking after the interests of the egg-producing industry, will not allow the producers to sell at a lower price to the under-privileged people of this country. I believe that this is a scandalous situation that has developed and that it requires the urgent attention not only of the hon. the Minister of Agriculture but of the whole Cabinet.</p>
<p>Let me say at once that I am acutely aware of the situation in which the egg farmers find themselves today due to the escalating costs of production. I believe that the greatest disservice has been done to them and to other sectors of the agricultural industry by this massive increase of 22% in the price of maize. We will know what that is going to do to the production costs of all those persons who are using maize as a basic commodity from which to produce food. I have spoken about the egg producers. One also has the broiler producer, Sir, the beef farmers, the dairy farmers, mutton farmers, pork producers and so forth. Those people face tremendous increases in the cost of production of their commodities. I believe this increase is going to lead to an increase of approximately 3 cents per litre on milk, 4 cents per dozen on eggs and 3 cents per kilogram on chicken, beef, mutton and pork.</p>

<from>Senator <person refersto="hansard">J. M. SLABBERT</person>:</from>
<p>What is your solution?</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#webber">
<from>Senator <person refersto="hansard">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>
<p>I shall come to that in a moment. The hon. Senator must not be impatient This is the situation that we have at the moment. We also have a cost of living spiral which showed an increase of 12,6% in the year from March 1978 to March 1979. That was even before these increases in the price of basic foodstuffs. Where are we going, Sir? We have already had the situation where the cost-of-living index rose by 1,7% from February to March of this year. If that is projected over a year, it will amount to an increase of over 20% in the cost of living over 12 short months. I do not believe the -people of South Africa can absorb that sort of increase in their cost of living and I believe that the Government should do something about curtailing it This 1,7% in one month was before any of the increases in the prices of basic foodstuffs. That was caused only by the fuel levy imposed by the Government and the general sales tax which was another action on the part of the Government As I have said, we now have an increase of R18 per ton in respect of maize or 22%. Coupled with that there has been an increase in the price to producers of R42 per ton or 12% in the case of groundnuts, R32 per ton or 17% in the case of sunflower seed and R31 per ton or 15% in the case of soya seed. Hon. Senators must realize what these two increases, linked with the other increases, mean to the poorer people of this country, people whose staple diet is maize, whose basic foodstuff is maize or maize products. They rely on these oils to provide them with the necessary proteins and fats. It is this Government that allowed the introduction of yellow margarine so that they could have a low price fat It was the hon. the Minister of Health who announced it. He said that the poorer people deserved a lower-price fat. What is this increase going to mean to margarine? I can only speculate as regards margarine. What is it going to mean to oil? I recently received the new prices of cooking oil, and while we have been selling a 750 ml bottle of cooking oil for 85 cents for some time now, i.e. for a year or more, when my next consignment arrives it is going to cost me 89 cents. That will be my cost price. The cost price to the retailer is going to be higher than the present retail price. It means that a bottle of oil will now have to be sold for more than R1 per bottle, and the supermarkets will be discounting it at that price. This tremendous increase in the price of maize is going to add to that. I do not know how the poorer people are going to be able to continue. One can imagine the untold misery that this is going to cause. I believe that the Government has to do something to cushion the effect of these increases on the consumers.</p>
<p>The first thing they can do, is to look at the maize which is at the moment stored in the silos. There are thousands of tons of last season’s maize still stored in those silos and that maize is now being sold at the new price that has been increased by R18 per ton. R18 per ton is going into the maize stabilization fund for every ton of that old maize which is sold. I believe that the first step that this Government must do, is to sell last season’s maize to food producers, to the egg producers, the chicken farmers, the beef pro ducers and mutton and pork producers; in other words, those who are producing food from maize, and that they should be able to buy that maize at the old price. That, of course, is going to reduce their input costs and that will eliminate the possibility of any further price increases in basic commodities, which has not yet happened. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>I rise, in fact, to refer in sorrow to a portion of the speech made in this House three days ago by the hon. Senator Swanepoel as the main speaker of the NRP, the official Opposition. I am sorry that the hon. Senator Swanepoel is not here at the moment. In his reply to the budget speech of the hon. the Minister of Finance three days ago, he said the following. I quote from the Hansard report of his speech—</p>
<block name="quote">Die bietjie kontak wat ek met die sakelewe het, het my oortuig dat die edele Minister se beeld glad nie na wense is onder die sakemanne wat ek ken nie.</block>
<p>Mr. President, before I go on, I want to pay tribute to the honesty of the hon. Senator Swanepoel because when he says that he has “bietjie kontak” (some contact) with the business world, he is saying in fact that his contact is insignificant.</p>

<p>I cannot repeat it; my time is too limited. I am just referring to the speech of the hon. Senator Swanepoel in reply to the budget speech of the hon. the Minister of Finance in which he spoke with great honesty about the small measure of contact he had with the business world. On the basis of that little measure of contact he says that the image of the Minister of Finance leaves much to be desired in the eyes of the business world. I am grateful to the hon. Senator for being honest enough to admit that his contact is very insignificant.</p>
<p>The hon. Senator Swanepoel went on and said something very strange. Once again I quote from the Hansard report of his speech in which he said the following—</p>
<block name="quote">Ek voel dat ons nooit ons ekonomie ten volle sal kan ontwikkel tensy ons in hierdie geval ook ’n verandering maak nie. Ek sê dit met al die erns tot my beskikking. Ek is glad nie ligsinnig daaroor nie.</block>
<p>He then proceeded in all seriousness to tell the House what changes should be effected and, having admitted that he had some contact with the business world, he advised the hon. the Minister to hand in his resignation to the hon. the Prime Minister. [Interjections.]</p>
<p>I want to know from the hon. the Leader of the Opposition, Senator Oelrich and the hon. Senator Horak whether they support this statement of their main speaker on finance. If they do not, will they then for the sake of truthfulness repudiate him? Because, Sir, the statement by the hon. Senator Swanepoel that the image of the hon. the Minister of Finance in the eyes of the business world of South Africa leaves much to be desired, that it is a poor one and that he should resign because of that, is completely untrue. Who are the few businessmen whom the hon. Senator knows? I am prepared to arrange a confrontation between any businessmen I know with those whom the hon. Senator Swanepoel knows. I call upon Dr. Anton Rupert in the first instance.</p>

<p>I shall not read the speech. I take it that hon. Senators read <i>Die</i> <i>Burger</i>; I take it that they can read Afrikaans. I shall just read a short extract from <i>Die</i> <i>Burger</i> of today. Yesterday at the junior congress of the Afrikaanse Handels-instituut in Johannesburg Dr. Rupert moved a motion of appreciation in Senator Horwood because according to him the latter, and I quote—</p>
<block name="quote">… het the skyf geword van persoonlike aanvalle …</block>
<p>Then the Opposition still has the temerity to deny that a personal vendetta is being waged against the hon. the Minister of Finance. Do they believe Dr. Rupert? If they do not accept what we say, do they accept what Dr. Rupert says? [Interjections.]</p>
<p>I can give hon. Senators of the Opposition further proof. Dr. Rupert asks why it is a personal vendetta and replies that it is because the hon. the Minister of Finance is following in the footsteps of his father who was the personal assistant to John X. Merriman at the time and the great friend of the Afrikanerbond in the Colony. Who is attacking him? They are the logical successors of Cecil John Rhodes, the man who engineered the Jameson raid. With due respect, Mr. President, I think Cecil John Rhodes would turn in his grave today if he were to see his successors in action.</p>
<p>I want to make one further quotation from what Dr. Rupert said, namely—</p>
<block name="quote">Ek laat nie vriende in die steek nie. Ek verkies lojaliteit en vriendskap bo geld. Dit is ook waar van die Afrikaner. Daarom my voorstel van waardering vir min. Owen Horwood. Die slag wat hy met sy jongste begroting vir vrye ondernemerskap geslaan het—selfs vir die diamantmyne—moet erken word.</block>
<p>†But Mr. President, these accolades of praise have not only been heaped on from the Afrikaner’s side. I have access to—and the hon. Senator Swanepoel can exercise that right too if he wants to—documents from which I cannot quote unfortunately, because they are confidential. I can however tell that hon. Senator that the hon. the Minister of Finance has also received congratulations, expressions of praise and appreciation from various other centres and also from English-speaking circles not only in South Africa but in the outside world. I will quote only one of these, and the hon. Senator Swanepoel can have access to these documents should he want to see them and confirm that my quotations are authentic. There is the telegram from one of the foremost industrialists in South Africa, and hon. Senators will be surprised to learn who this is. He said—</p>
<block name="quote">It is fortunate for South Africa that someone of your ability is available to control our financial affairs at this time.</block>
<p>Another person said—</p>
<block name="quote">In presenting a budget so well-knit and so well-directed, you have laid the ghost of uncertainty which has been haunting this country ever since the shroud of depression descended on us four years ago.</block>
<p>Another one says this—</p>
<block name="quote">You and your aides deserve every accolade which your budget deserves.</block>
<p>“It was tremendous,” wires another person from very influential circles and continues—</p>

<p>These messages of congratulation have come not only from financial circles in South Africa, but also from overseas. One of the most outstanding bankers in Switzerland said that he had been shocked to read a report in the <i>Sunday Times</i> of South Africa—he may have been shocked, but I am not surprised— which indicated that South Africa’s gold policy and the Minister’s alleged role in this so-called Information scandal had undermined the confidence of overseas investors in the Minister himself and in South Africa. He refuted the argument in this South African newspaper with contempt.</p>
<p>*That is the result, Mr. President, which, as I said recently in a speech, we should expect here in South Africa. The hon. Senator Oelrich as the Leader of the Opposition and the hon. Senator Horak as a highly esteemed member of the Opposition, should realize that when one does anything that affects the Minister of Finance in a country like South Africa one also affects the entire financial integrity and the entire structure of the country. Over the past 50 years we have not had many Ministers of Finance but every one of them has been the personification of trustworthiness, credibility and reliability in the South African economy. The Opposition can carry on with their personal attacks on the Minister of Finance but then they must face up to the charge that by doing so they are undermining the integrity of South Africa.</p>

<p>Mr. President, that is what we on this side of the House find so distressing. We are prepared to admit every one of our weaknesses and we are prepared to accept criticism but when campaigns are conducted at a level where persons are denigrated, when character assassination takes place, we dig in our heels. I think the businessmen of South Africa, including those in finance and mining who have seen what has been happening and who know of this sustained and continuous vendetta against the hon. Senator Horwood, our Minister of Finance, over the past days and weeks in this hon. House, should do what Dr. Anton Rupert has done and say: Thus far and no further, because what you are doing is to cast doubt on the integrity of an honourable person, and by doing that to someone who preserves and guards our financial strength, soundness and progress in such a remarkable way, you are also harming South Africa.</p>
<p>†I was most grieved, Sir. The hon. Senator Winchester said: “How can you sit still, and say nothing.” But as far as this character assassination is concerned, I will give another example which is really distressing. In last Sunday’s <i>Sunday Times</i> on the front page, the following heading appears: “Oh! Dr. Poorter! What an Odd Degree!” I am glad his brother, the hon. Senator Laurie Poorter, is not here because now I can speak openly. This article ridicules Dr. John Poorter, editor <i>of To The Point</i> by implying very clearly that he got his honorary doctorate, that he virtually bought it, from a certain gentleman in Springs.</p>
<p>I have never seen a worse example of character assassination than this. I also have here a telex from the Rev. Trevor Swart, general secretary of the Baptist Union which says this—</p>
<block name="quote">Dr. John Poorter has had a distinguished academic record. He is a graduate of the Bible Institute of South Africa, Cape Province, and subsequently completed the four year theological course for ministerial recognition of the Baptist Union with honours, obtaining a higher aggregate of marks for the total course than any student previously registered with the Union. He has a B.A. with history and English majors from the University of South Africa, a B.A. Hons, in theology from the University of Natal; an M.A. <i>cum laude</i> from the University of Natal for what many have described as a brilliant thesis on the theology of C. S. Lewis. He has done postgraduate work at the University of London. He holds an <i>honoris causa</i> Doctor of Divinity degree from Bob Jones University, U.S.A., in recognition of his scholarship and Christian leadership.</block>
<p>Mr. President, does this man, even if he is editor of <i>To The Point</i>, deserve this destruction, this murder, this venomous attack on his character? Does the Opposition really agree with that?</p>

<p>Mr. President, I am sorry that I have to raise this matter again and I sincerely trust that this will be the end of it Hon. Senators of the Opposition must realize that what has been set in motion must come to an end and we shall have to face up to that within a few weeks’ time. Thereafter we hope that we shall have a clear picture of what the position is in connection with this Information matter and that steps will be taken to put an end to these mutual recriminations and charges against Ministers, other people and Senators on this side of the House. I am Sorry but I shall have to come back to this subject at a later stage because South Africa, our country, is at the moment calling upon everyone of us, including the members of the Opposition and everyone in the country, White and Black, as well as all the countries in Southern Africa, to show a new spirit, a new desire and a new determination. We must make use of this atmosphere which has apparently suddenly changed in our favour, so that we can create a situation of peaceful co-existence and cooperation in this southern country, this subcontinent of Africa.</p>
<p>We are faced suddenly with a position in which two reports, the Wiehahn report and the Riekert report, have opened new horizons for us. There may be problems for some people in the country. [Interjections.] We only hear about the spirit that the White man must show but the Wiehahn report and the Riekert report demand above all else from the Black man, the Black spokesman and the Black leader that measure of self-discipline, self-control and recognition of the rights of others on which our country’s future has to be built. We are faced with a position in which there has suddenly been a change in the attitude of one of the five powers who have to decide jointly on the fate of Southern Africa. I refer to Great Britain. We must not expect too much from that Government; far from it because, just like any other government, yes, just like ours, the new British Government decides on its policy, its actions and attitudes on the basis of what is in its own national interests. That also applies in the case of South Africa. But I am sure that the new Government in Britain will adopt a more realistic approach towards the problems of Southern Africa. I hope that the people of Rhodesia will find one another and that they will realize that the one thing that can destroy Rhodesia today is disunity among themselves. White and Black, Black and Black must reach the stage where they recognize one another. We are faced with a possible change in the South African situation. The position is not hopeless. It is possible that the position in South West Africa may change. The position is not hopeless, therefore, Sir. We have clear proof of that The hon. Senator Horak must admit that there is increasing dissatisfaction with the laxity of the Carter administration. Not only are we about to have a change in the attitude of countries abroad that can be to our benefit and that can assist us in solving our problems but we ourselves are also trying to create an atmosphere in South Africa itself, this multi-national country, that will pave the way for a better future. That is why every one of us, instead of wallowing in something as unsavoury as the Information affair and involving innocent people, should stand together and show a better spirit in this country. Time, circumstances, possibilities and our potential demand that of us. Sir, the results of the by-elections at Swellendam and elsewhere will prove that the people of South Africa want such a spirit.</p>

<p>Mr. President it is very obvious to me that the hon. Senator who has just resumed his seat and who dragged the name of the editor of <i>To The Point</i> into this debate is very sensitive about the recent information we have had about <i>To The Point.</i> [Interjections.] I leave it at that, Sir, and I do not want any interruptions from the hon. ex-editor of the <i>Vader-land.</i> I will deal further with him at a later stage. [Interjections.] An hon. Senator says “gee my the rede”. It needs no imagination to see that that hon. Senator is very sensitive about the situation. I shall leave it to the padres on the other side to deal with that matter.</p>
<p>I think the hon. Senator should be careful, Sir, because people who live in glass houses should not throw stones. He threw a stone at my friend, the hon. Senator Swanepoel, about the few businessmen whom he knows. But his own NP organ here in the Cape, <i>Die Burger</i>, referred to that hon. gentleman after his famous speech when the Police Bill was discussed and when he said something very nice about the police. It reminded him that he was not the editor of all the newspapers in the country and that he had been the editor of only a minor newspaper in the past.</p>
<p>That hon. Senator talked about character assassination but what did he do here this afternoon? Why did he hammer on the personality of the hon. Senator Crook. Is that not character assassination? [Interjections.] I am told that the hon. Senator asked for it, Sir! I want to put what they say to the test. I will be pleased if the bench-mate of the hon. Senator Van Schoor would confirm that he has also sat on a Select Committee of this House. He need only nod his head. The fact that he does not reply and remains immobile means that he agrees. The hon. Senator served umpteen times on Select Committees asked for by that side of the House in an attempt to muzzle the hon. Senator Crook. I wonder whether the hon. the Minister of Finance will give me his opinion on this. I refer to a statement the hon. Senator made in this very House in March of this year. Did the hon. Senator not say that select committees consisted of two groups of people, one group appointed by the Government and the other group appointed by the Opposition, and that every time that happened there was no real conclusion? The hon. Senator also said in this House: “This is an exercise in futility.” Yet hon. Senators opposite use the findings of that Select Committee to try to assassinate the character of the hon. Senator Crook. That hon. gentleman was a member of that select committee. Does he agree?</p>

For the information of the hon. Senator Van Zijl the reference is column 509 of Tuesday, 6 March of this year. There he will see exactly what he said. He said a select committee was in fact “an exercise in futility”. However, hon. Senators opposite use the findings of a select committee in order to assassinate the character of the hon.

I am pleased to know that he has behaved so correctly and courteously towards an Independent At the same time I want to apologize for not having been present in this Chamber on Thursday when he delivered his budget speech. I was not away like most hon. Senators who were fighting by-elections. I was attending to matters in my constituency to which I will refer later in my speech.</p>

<p>Among other things he said: <i>“The Citizen</i> het niks gedoen aan die uitslae van die verkiesing in 1977 nie.” What double talk, Sir! Hon. Senators opposite have paid tribute in this House to the Erasmus Commission. Let me quote what the Erasmus Commission says in its report I quote from page 60, paragraph 9.263—</p>

He is pessimistic about the situation and that is why he talks so glibly and says this sort of thing about a responsible person who talks responsibly.

<p>Sir, I am now going to talk on a subject which I hope will gladden the heart of the hon. the Minister of Finance. I trust that he will have an opportunity of replying to it in his reply to the debate. I am perfectly sure that despite all the bouquets that were showered on him over the last two days, not one single hon. Senator on the other side dared to raise this matter for fear that they might embarrass the hon. the Minister. Sir, what I am saying was sparked off not by the Opposition but by former and present members of the Nationalist Party. If I may use the words of the hon. Senator Van Staden: “Hulle het the saak weer oopge-skrap.”</p>
<p>*Sir, the matter at issue here is the photo question which was mentioned by the hon. Minister of Finance in the Other Place. I have extracts from <i>The Argus</i> in which the situation is described which led to this new trend in the Information scandal. I quote a report from <i>The Argus</i> of Tuesday, 8 May, which contains what the hon. the Minister of Finance said in the Other Place.</p>
<p>†I quote—</p>
<block name="quote">The Minister of Finance, Senator Owen Horwood, yesterday called on the editor of the <i>Rand Daily Mail</i>, Mr. Allister Sparks, to say whether he was in possession of an album of photographs in connection with Dr. Connie Mulder. Senator Horwood, speaking during his Vote in Committee of Supply, said he had been asked what possible reason there could be for Dr. Mulder, the former Minister of Information, to launch an attack on him six months after he had given evidence to the Erasmus Commission. “What motivation does Dr. Mulder have to attack me now?” the hon. Senator asked. I want to ask him: “Did he go to Dr. Connie Mulder and ask him to make an attack on me or did Dr. Mulder go to him and asked him to make an attack on me?” Senator Horwood said there was talk about this album of photographs which Dr. Rhoodie had. The <i>Rand Daily Mail</i> had published certain of these photographs.</block>
<p>The hon. the Minister is then quoted as having said—</p>
<block name="quote">I want to ask the editor of the <i>Rand Daily Mail</i>: Does he have the album of Dr. Rhoodie’s pictures, did he buy them from Dr. Rhoodie and, if so, how much did he pay for them?” Senator Horwood said that if the <i>Rand Daily Mail</i> had such pictures, he wished to ask the newspaper to publish them. Mr. Sparks should say how he got the pictures.</block>
<p>Sir, I do not think this is a very nice thing for a responsible Minister to have said. I am, however, mentioning this matter in order to give the hon. the Minister a chance to reply.</p>
<p><i>The Cape Times</i> of Wednesday, 9 May, has the following to say, and I quote—</p>
<block name="quote">Editor’s reply to album challenge.<br/>The editor of the <i>Rand Daily Mail</i>, Mr. Allister Sparks, yesterday issued the following statement in reply to a challenge issued in the House of Assembly on Monday by Senator Horwood. “Senator Horwood has implied that we are in possession of these pictures of Dr. Connie Mulder and that we have used these to blackmail Dr. Mulder into attacking Senator Horwood. The insinuation is devoid of any shred of truth. I do not know whether any such pictures exist The Rand Daily Mail certainly does not have any in its possession, nor have we ever seen or heard of any. And even if we were ever to find ourselves in possession of any such material relating to anyone at all, we would never dream of using it in the way Senator Horwood insinuates. It must be a matter for the gravest concern that a Cabinet Minister who holds a position of high public responsibility should make such a damaging insinuation without any basis in fact whatsoever.”</block>
<p>This is a very, very serious allegation by a newspaper. I think the hon. the Minister should do something about it. I quote further—</p>
<block name="quote">“If Senator Horwood had any facts at all to back his statement, it would be his duty to take them to the nearest attorney-general to institute a prosecution. But, of course, Senator Horwood will not do this because he cannot.”</block>

<p>Thank you, Mr. President According to the latest annual report of the Department of Agricultural Economics and Marketing the farmers’ debts amounted to R2 660 million at the beginning of 1978, compared to R2 311 the previous year; that is an increase of R349 million within a period of one year and I am sure that this amount has increased further since then.</p>
<p>If we look at the statistics, we must realize that the farming sector as such has had good seasons for the past few years. We have a drought at present, and I think the lean years lie ahead. I think it is cyclical. But if the farmer found it so difficult to build up capital in the good years and had to incur further loans, one realizes what the position is going to be in the years ahead, Sir. What is more, the percentage of debt against capital invested in farming increased from 12,2% to 13% in one year, and that is really disturbing.</p>
<p>The agricultural industry is experiencing difficult times now and it is disturbing. Producer prices will have to be raised and the consumers will have to carry the burden.</p>

We farmers are not a charitable institution and I think it was always the policy of the old UP that when the costs of food production rose to the extent that the lower income groups could no longer afford essential foodstuffs, the central Government had to subsidize the consumer, that is, from the Treasury.</p>

<p>I think the hon. the Minister has given an indication that he is sympathetic in this matter. During the period 1974-’77—and the hon. Senator from Zulu Farm must listen carefully—the net producer price of maize rose by only 29%, while in the same period tractor prices—and, Sir, you know that unlike the Zulus we cannot produce maize without tractors, we must have tractors—increased by 83% and the price of farming equipment by 79%.</p>

<p>Mr. President, I find this typical when price increases occur. Over the years we have had record maize crops. In 1973-’74 we had a record maize crop of 10 610 million tons and even last year we harvested 9 806 million tons, but this year the crop will not even be 7 000 million tons. In other words, many of the farmers will not be a single cent better off as a result of the increased maize price. They will have no crop.</p>

<p>Yes, he is a retired farmer, but other people have to cope with the problem. Sir, the drought is very serious, and I want to refer specifically to my region, the Marico district We live on the border and we guard the border to keep the people behind the Liesbeek safe. Representations were made to the magistrate to have that region declared a drought-stricken area. One does not easily resort to this, but the situation is very serious. I want to read a few quotations from the memorandum which was originally drawn up in support of these representations. We show that in April 1978 we had 33 mm rain; in May, June, July and August, no rain; in September, 25 mm; October, 20 mm; November, 35 mm; December 35 mm; January, 21 mm; February, 57 mm; March, 23 mm and April none. That is a total of 248 mm, while the average rainfall there is over 500 mm. There is nothing the farmer can do about this situation. Tins is also typical of many other areas.</p>

<from>*Senator <person refersto="hansard">J. H. D. E. DU TOIT</person>:</from>
<p>Let me tell the hon. the Minister of Finance in a serious vein that at the moment the position is, that drought relief can be given to the farmers in two ways. The first is a rebate on rail tariffs for the transport of stock feed and animals. The position today is such that even in the Free State where the hon. Senator Groene-wald comes from, one cannot buy fodder. It is no use giving a rebate on the transport of fodder. The only fodder that one can probably buy is yellow maize and at a price which our farmers also have to pay because their fellow-farmers got an increase in price.</p>
<p>The second sort of aid which can be given is in the form of loans to the farmer at a low or subsidized interest rate, which he will start repaying after five years, to buy feed and licks. I think it will only take the farmer from the frying pan into the fire if additional credit is extended which he will eventually have to repay. I hope that the hon. the Minister and the Jacobs Committee that has been appointed will look at the farmers’ plight and give some attention to this matter. I really think it is no use extending further credit to the farmers who are already deep in debt, not through any fault of their own but through circumstances. I hope some way will be found to make the help which they are given under these circumstances more effective.</p>
<p>Then we come to the dairy industry, and I must say that this is something which surprises me. I am not only a red meat farmer but I also produce industrial milk. I produce industrial milk, unlike the hon. Senator who gets lovely fat prices for his fresh milk. In this hon. House the then Minister of Health stood up an recommended that the margarine industry should be allowed to colour margarine yellow. The Minister of Agriculture sat there and did not say a word. Now we find that the present Minister of Agriculture—and he is a glib fellow; I see he simply gets on his motor-cycle and rides to Darling when he has big worries—says that he might withdraw yellow margarine. But, Sir, that would be ludicrous. The harm has been done. If he were to take yellow margarine off the market now he would be doing the lower bracket wage earners an injustice. There just is no butter today to take the place of margarine, and this has come about because of Government policy.</p>
<p>I do not want to plead the cause of the margarine industry but now those people are being accused of making false propaganda as to the value of margarine. But, Sir, they were assisted by the then Minister of Health. He said that margarine was healthier than butter but now we have no butter supplies in the country and it would be a great injustice to withdraw yellow margarine at this stage. I think the hon. the Minister would be stupid if he did that, and his statements will not benefit the agricultural industry because once again it will be said that the farmers of South Africa are spoon-fed by the Government, as the hon. consumers on the other side usually say. I hope I have made my point here. It seems to me that the hon. the Minister is worried but he probably did not hear me ask for the second hour.</p>

<speech by="#jager">
<from>*Senator <person refersto="hansard">D. F. DE JAGER</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President, I am not going to speak on the Information debacle today. I just want to remind the House of what the hon. Senator Dippenaar said the other day in connection with Swellendam. If the NRP took a proper look at the results at Swellendam and those at Beaufort West, they would be ashamed of themselves for having taken up the time of this House, not just by trying to get at the Minister but by asking the Minister to resign so that an election can be held. I just want to tell the hon. the Leader of the Opposition that if that is an indication of how the public are going to vote, I advise them never to go to the country because look what happened in spite of everything that was in their favour to get the public on their side. The fact of the matter is that the NP is not a party of persons; it is a party of principles. We are a national movement. If we are cross about something, we talk about it. We sometimes talk about one another which we should not do, but when the day comes for us to vote, we know whom to vote for. We vote for South Africa; we do not vote for a person. That is the difference, Mr. President.</p>
<p>I want to tell the hon. the Minister of Finance that we have the greatest respect for him. In 1972 he said in this House that he saw the day coming—he said before the ’eighties—when the price of gold would rise to $80. What did hon. Senators of the Opposition say? Today they have to recant My advice to them is that they recant what they have had to say about the Information affair.</p>
<p>We must look at what South Africa means to us. If we look at the main budget, the Railway budget and the Post Office budget as well, the three independent budgets, and when we see that about R17 billion is spent in South Africa, then it is a scandal for this Opposition to complain about a few million rand. I want to say immediately that I do not like it You do not like it, Sir, nobody likes it. But they have now set a massive witchhunt in motion against the hon. the Minister of Finance. He did not spend that money. It was another Minister who neglected to see that that work was done properly.</p>
<p>I just want to tell the Opposition that at the next election we shall deal with them in the same way as they were dealt with by Beaufort West and Swellendam.</p>
<p>Mr. President, I want now to come to my part of the world. I want to thank the State for the powerful Air Force base that has been established at Hoedspruit for the protection of our eastern border, as well as the army base that is being built at Phalaborwa and the delicate equipment at Mariepskop. This has all been done to safeguard our eastern border.</p>
<p>I want to refer at once to Foscor which is a semi-State institution at Phalaborwa. Foscor has been run economically for a number of years. Each year it pays dividends to the IDC; it pays tax to the State and provides job opportunities for a very large number of White as well as Black workers. Foscor has also made a very big contribution to the economy of the country. In this connection I want to refer particularly to the production costs of Foscor in contrast to the cost increases in related industries and particularly to the unprecedented increases in the prices of fertilizer. Foscor has neutralized its cost increases through increased productivity per labour unit and in this way it was also able to make its contribution to the farming community to enable it to produce food at a low price. For the past few years Foscor has been able to show a net profit of approximately R9 million. But if we look at price increases in the private sector in connection with the manufacture of fertilizers, we have no option but to throw our hands in the air and ask: “Where will it all end?”</p>
<p>There is another problem which is rearing its head and that is the possibly monopolistic circumstances which can develop in this sensitive industry. According to information, AECI already owns 49% of Triomf and, according to reports in financial periodicals, the position is as follows—</p>
<block name="quote">Though Luyt insists he will be in control of Triomf in 25 years, one of the most persistent items of market talk is that he would like out One stockbroker’s newsletter reported that Luyt was keen to sell to Federate Volksbeleggings. Other sources maintain that the take-over is by Luyt’s 49% partner in Triomf, AECI.</block>
<p>If AECI does not take over directly, they can quite easily do it through one of their international subsidiaries. They could then even make use of security rands to get possession of it at a cheap price. Monopolies have never catered for the interests of the consumer. I want to ask the State to keep an eye on this position. Indirect control can, of course, be obtained by AECI, as I have already mentioned. While I am speaking of Foscor, I want to refer to another company, namely PMC, Phalaborwa Mining Company. This company operates the largest open-cast copper mine in the southern hemisphere. PMC showed an astounding profit of R36 million in 1977, after R13 million had been written off, and R43 million in 1978 after R14 million had been written off. In 1977 its tax amounted to R14,6 million and in 1978 it was R19 million. I want to refer to these two large undertakings which have contributed towards the sound development of the whole eastern portion of the Letaba district and towards providing job opportunities for the population.</p>
<p>I want to make an appeal to the hon. the Minister of Finance this afternoon. Years ago, in 1964 and 1965, a determined effort was made to establish sugar in the Lowveld. I have mentioned this before when the Hon. the Minister of Agriculture was here. I am also aware of the fact that this matter actually falls under the Minister of Economic Affairs. The former Minister of Finance, the late Dr. Diederichs, was then Minister of Economic Affairs, and he issued a provisional permit on 19 June 1965. The hon. the Minister of Finance need not use money accruing to the Treasury from outside this district. I want to ask the hon. the Minister if he will not use his good offices to get the PMC and the State to the stage where they will establish a sugar industry in the Lowveld. This will have tremendous advantages, Sir. Foscor and PMC have thousands of Black people living in good three-bedroomed houses in their environs and also at Phalaborwa. There are thousands of other Black people living in the Black areas who have no fixed income. The land is there and water can be laid on. If we could get the farmers who are going through such difficult times at the moment to plant sugar, the Black farmers too, we would have an established farming community, Black and White, there, which could serve as a strong buffer against the influence of Frelimo just the other side of the border. They all speak Tsonga and they are all Shangaans. If we could establish those people as farmers and they all had somewhere to live they would not be so ready to listen to the people on the other side of the boarder. We have continually to send back thousands of these people because there are no job opportunities for them. We must also not forget that those people have a psychological influence on the people on our side. They are governed by a Black government and the people on this side are governed by a White government, and they are ripe for indoctrination.</p>
<p>When I speak of sugar, my intention is not so much to ask that sugar mills be constructed. The position in Brazil at present is that they do not have the coal to produce ethanol. The have decided to use sugar and maize to produce ethanol.</p>
<p>I think it is important that Sentrachem are going to invest R350 million in a project of this nature. If Sentrachem can develop such a project, then I think the State can do so as well in order to act as a stabilizing factor in the Lowveld. I do not think things are really so bad for the sugar farmers. If one looks at the financial statements of Tongaat and Huletts, one sees that they made a very good profit in 1977. They need not be ashamed of the profits they have made. But what seems stupid to me and the consumer public is that they use magic figures to try to get an increase in the price of their products. And they are granted.</p>

<p>Mr. President, as I say, such a sugar industry would create new job opportunities for both Black and White people. If an ethanol industry can be established, those hundreds of tankers which run from Sasol to Phalaborwa could load ethanol in that same area for mixing at the Sasol complex.</p>
<p>I should like to ask the hon. the Minister to consider something in regard to diamonds. I want to refer to an article which appeard on 14 March in <i>The Argus</i> in which it was said that the Israeli diamond industry has shown tremendous expansion. The production today is 200 times greater than it was in 1948. I want to ask the hon. the Minister if it is not possible to increase the size of the diamond-cutting industry in this country. We need only look at the financial statements of De Beers and at the reports of its marketing organizations. Most of the diamonds are exported to London, from where they are sent back to South Africa. London is the central sales organisation’s main depot. In terms of the Government’s attitude at present that we should first look to our own interests, this industry could provide us with a considerable amount of revenue.</p>
<p>Another question I want to put to the hon. the Minister is whether the State is also obtaining its rightful share revenue from the sale of those diamonds which are sold in Europe at the increased premium of 40% which the selling organization imposed on the sale of diamonds last year.</p>
<p>Secondly, I want to ask the hon. the Minister if it is not possible for the State to increase its production of diamonds from its diggings so that we could have the benefit of the increased prices which diamonds are fetching on world markets today.</p>
<p>Now I come to Sasol. The Permanent Cabinet Committee and the Energy Policy Committee and Secretariat envisage the fol lowing measures: Preparation of legislation, realistic programme for coal exports; substitution for coal gas by fuel oils as a source of energy for industries in the country’s most important industrial areas; the readiness of the authorities to identify and counter any adverse balance in the consumer patterns of petroleum products which cannot be accommodated by the refineries; a comprehensive programme for the strategic storage of petroleum; continued research and development by Sasol in the field of coal gas; the establishment of a national committee for energy research; the development and commercialization of a new uranium enrichment process by Ucor; and the construction by Escom of South Africa’s first nuclear power station. I want to ask the hon. the Minister, in view of that terrible accident that nearly happened in America and, as one reads in all the newspapers, the fact that people all over the world are now afraid of the use of uranium and nuclear power stations, whether our Government—we are one of the largest producers of uranium—should not approach newspapers overseas and place large advertisements in them to show that, in spite of that occurrence South Africa, has the fullest confidence in nuclear power stations and that South Africa will continue with the development of its uranium enrichment process for the benefit of the world. Exceptionally good progress has been made at Sasol II and, because circumstances have so changed, the Government has decided to increase the staff there to 20 000. We are confronted with great problems in connection with unemployment these days, and I want to point out that through the actions of the State, this will indirectly be a major source of job opportunities for these people.</p>
<p>I also want to refer to the training programme being undertaken there. Approximately 650 workers, White, Black and Coloured, are at present being trained in various categories of welding, pipe-laying and pipe installation. But, Mr. President, what is important, is that more than 3 000 have already completed their training.</p>
<p>As a result of the training which the men receive at Sasol I, Sasol II will experience fewer problems in regard to training because they will get trained people to do the work. I should like to refer to the group turnover at Sasol I. Nowhere is the success of Sasol I’s traditional striving for productivity better reflected than in the latest financial report of the company. The group turnover was R832 million for the year 1977-’78. This was the highest in Sasol’s history and is an increase of R140 million over the R692 for the previous year. The profit before tax for the year was R 114,7 million. After tax it was R73,3 million.</p>
<p>Mr. President, I should like to refer again to a speech I made here a few years ago. At the time everyone was clamouring for the abolition of State institutions. This afternoon we have already had proof of Foscor, and here again proof of Sasol, which shows that the State-founded companies are contributing their share to the country’s economy. They pay tax to the State and dividends to the IDC which provides them with the necessary funds.</p>
<p>Increases in the prices of many of Sasol’s products have undoubtedly contributed to the improvement in the company’s financial returns. Sir, you will remember that from the beginning we have said that the economic viability of the Sasol II project will depend largely on the maintenance of a reasonable relationship between the increased capital costs of the installation during the construction period and the prices of petroleum products. In actual fact the international price of petroleum has not risen as quickly as the installation and equipment costs have. I think that in the meantime there has been a slight change in the position because there has been another price adjustment.</p>
<p>Sir, I want now to refer to the productivity of Sasol. To return to the good financial returns of the past few years, I say again that these speak volumes for the dedication shown by the whole Sasol organization in its striving for greater productivity and profitability in all its activities. I should like to mention a few examples of what has been achieved recently. During the past six years the yield and turnover of group products, expressed in tons per employee, increased by 32%. During the past three years the value of production increased by 89%. The total manpower increased by only 8% while the physical production in tons per employee—this includes White and non-White—rose by 14%. The total manpower of the present production units at Sasolburg was reduced by 8,6% during the past year, while a reduction of 13,8% is envisaged for 1979.</p>
<p>In the factory laboratory a reduction of 7,3% has already been achieved and the aim is 23%.</p>
<p>Sir, I want to refer to the life expectancy of Sasol. At the time of construction they envisaged 100% production. As a result of the new methods our people are now applying, we now have a production of 160% of the original capacity.</p>
<p>I also want to refer to coal consumption. It is interesting to note that last year Sasol used 5,1 million tons of coal for the manufacture of its products. It is pleasing to be able to say that Sasol’s new techniques for the processing of coal will be implemented at the new Sasol IL The main contractor at the Sasol II project—and for the extensions to that project—is an American construction company, and this afternoon I want to make an appeal to the hon. the Minister that when America negotiates with our country for the use of our processes in America, the State will look first to the interests of South Africa. I read a report recently that America wants to go so far as to expel South African students who want to qualify in energy studies at American universities. I want to say immediately that the same America which gets uranium and all the other minerals from our country has said openly that it will not supply us with enriched uranium for the Koeberg power station. Thanks to the Government’s involvement with and the support of the National Institute for Metallurgy, they can go ahead with the South African process and improve it so that we shall shortly be manufacturing our own fuel at Pelindaba.</p>
<p>I want now to refer to the use of South African expertise in the industry. The original industry commenced by using the American Fisher Tropps and German processes. Every-body who knows Sasol will know that the projects sold to us by those two mighty nations were not able to get going for years. It was the expertise of our own people that simplified and improved those processes so that today—as I have already said—there can be a reduction in the number of technicians whom they have to employ and they have a better process which America would very much like to have. That is why I say that is a giant among the giants. I want to suggest to the hon. the Minister of Finance that if a request is received for us to make our knowledge available to them, we take a hard bargaining line. We must say to them: We shall negotiate with you, but we want something in exchange for what we have to offer you.</p>
<p>Mr. President, in the last minute at my disposal I want to refer to the export of coal. The oil companies have entered the field of coal exports. Richards Bay was developed for the export of coal. But what are the oil companies doing? They are going over the heads of the Transvaal Coal Owners’ Association. They do not want to export their coal through an established and recognized body. They want to go their own way. [Time Expired.]</p>

<p>Thank you very much. I know very little about the subjects he was discussing, but one of them in particular did interest me, i.e. the question of atomic power stations. A little while ago I read that it had been suggested that an investigation into the erection of such a power station be considered for the Natal coast [Interjections.] I want to say to the hon. Senator who has just resumed his seat, who obviously knows more about the subject than I do, that I personally believe that a great deal more research into the safety of these power stations is needed than has been done up to date. I for one am completely unconvinced of the safety measures, in view of the recent accidents overseas, in regard to power stations, their use and their viability in South Africa. I have a horrible suspicion that the experts are tending to dodge the issue, and I hope some day to discuss this particular matter with my hon. friend who has just resumed his seat.</p>
<p>Mr. President in the time available to me at this late stage in the afternoon, I want to begin by saying to the hon. the Minister that there is no question that the Riekert and the Wiehahn Commissions have established a watershed in South Africa politics. In my personal view this is the finest development that has taken place in South Africa since the NP came to power in 1948. I believe it heralds not only a new era but also the complete abandonment of NP policy in the very foreseeable future. I think that the essense of these two reports means that the South African Government at long last has recognized that all the people living in South Africa are citizens of South Africa and that our economy depends on the fair treatment of all these race groups as citizens of the country. I therefore hold nothing back in regard to my gratitude in respect of these two commissions: My only hope is that the Government will act on their recommendations speedily before the aspirations of the people concerned are not raised too high with very little development to follow.</p>
<p>Having said that, Sir, I am sorry that I must once again refer to the Department of Information matter. [Interjections.] I am sorry to have to do so, because there are very many problems facing South Africa. We have problems in regard to South West Africa where we have just had brutal murders committed. [Interjections.] Hon. Senators should just listen for a moment and they might learn something for a change. Something might get through their heads. Mr. President, we have plenty of problems in South Africa. We have problems of inflation. We have been told by hon. Senators on the other side that they are hoping for a growth rate of approximately 4%. But we need a growth rate of more than 5% to provide sufficient jobs for the people in South Africa. Anything under 5% is therefore in fact a crisis situation in regard to the provision of jobs. We have a number of factors that need urgent attention. For instance, we have the cost of living that is running out of control. Praises has been heaped on the hon. the Minister of Finance’s shoulders by hon. Senators on that side of the House, and that is a natural thing for them to do, but he has still not been able to control the galloping inflation rate and the runaway cost of living that make it harder and harder for people to make ends meet. These, Sir, are the problems we have to face. But we cannot face them because of the very fact that the man who is in charge of South Africa’s finances, the man who is in charge of South Africa’s money, the public money in South Africa, is losing credibility every day with the people of South Africa. And, Sir, I say it is of his own making because it seems to me that every time he makes a statement, every time he opens his mouth, he puts his foot in it.</p>

<p>Mr. President, the Information scandal is going to go on and on and on because it is fed by the hon. the Minister of Finance. He adds fuel to the flames all the time. It was once said by Gladstone in reply to a member in the House of Commons who asked him whether he should speak: “It is better that people wonder why you don’t speak than wonder why you do.” I often wonder when the hon. the Minister speaks, why he speaks at all, and I am talking about matters of this nature; because every time he opens his mouth he puts his foot right into it.</p>
<p>Mr. President, I want to deal with a couple of things. The hon. the Minister of Finance says, for instance, that he initialled and signed a certain document and he made certain that he did not see what was in that document. Mr. President, have you ever heard of any person in any walk of life signing something of which he has no knowledge? But here we are dealing with a Minister of Finance who signed something but says he covered the items concerned. Yet he happily signed it and then, later on, he happily cancelled his signature on a document that he knew nothing about! This is the Minister of Finance! What sort of Minister of Finance is he?</p>

<p>He said in so many words that the <i>Rand Daily Mail</i> was blackmailing ex-Minister Connie Mulder. If he believes that, he should have gone to the nearest police station or to the Attorney-General to lay a charge. He failed in his duty by not doing so. That is another aspect of the hon. the Minister of Finance’s conduct.</p>
<p>I would also like to ask the hon. the Minister of Finance, in fact, I would like to ask any Minister in the Cabinet—and we have another Minister present in the House at the moment—how many of them were aware that when the three newspapers were charged by the Press Council with publishing false reports in regard to <i>To The Point</i>, this in fact was a miscarriage of justice? And having known that it was a miscarriage of justice, what did they do about it? Mr. President, I do not know how many of these Ministers were aware of the fact that a miscarriage of justice had taken place in regard to this matter, but it is certain that the former Prime Minister knew and nothing was done about it. This, I believe, is one of the most serious things that happened in this whole sorry story in regard to the Department of Information.</p>
<p>Mr. President, the hon. the Minister of Finance says that his hands are clean, and I do not believe that anybody on this side here or in the Other Place has suggested that the hon. the Minister benefited personally by what took place in the Department of Information. Sir, his hands may be clean, he may not have benefited personally but every shred of evidence that has emerged in regard to this matter, this very sorry matter in South African politics, has clearly indicated that he is the most incompetent Minister of Finance that this country has ever had.</p>
<p>This must be so because the whole record of the Erasmus Commission, regardless of what it tries to say, in fact leaves the impression that we have a Minister of Finance totally incompetent to carry out his duties. This, I believe, is the worst thing that has emerged from this whole scandal of the Department of Information. That is why I say the hon. the Minister of Finance is not only South Africa’s worst enemy; while he continues in this office no member of the South African public can have any confidence in this Government.</p>

<p>Mr. President, I am not going to give the hon. Senator my opinion as to who was the best, but I know who is the worst. I know who is the most incompetent. Can the hon. Chief Whip on the other side tell me if any of the previous Ministers of Finance would have closed his eyes or turned the page in such a way that he was able to sign a document giving away millions of rands of public money without seeing what he was signing for? Would he then have cancelled his signature also unseen? Can he tell me of any Minister of Finance who would have done that? Can any hon. Senator on the other side say that any previous Minister of Finance, knowing that there was something wrong in the handling of money for the Department of Information, knowing that he had objected to the way it was being handled, would not have had the courage to resign from his office.</p>

<p>And he did not know about it? The hon. Senator should not make himself out to be more silly than he is. I am asking what Minister of Finance deliberately closed his eyes when he knew that there was something wrong in a department? Whether his hands are clean or not—and I will accept that they are—I repeat that he is the most incompetent Minister of Finance we have had in our history. As such the public of South Africa are entitled to wonder whether we can have any confidence in such a Minister of Finance. But when he attacks the <i>Rand Daily Mail</i> I believe he is going much too far. He virtually accuses the <i>Rand Daily Mail</i> of blackmail and he accuses Dr. Mulder of things that did not happen. Both of them have denied it. The <i>Rand Daily Mail</i> says there is not a shred of truth in what he has said and it will be very interesting to see if the Minister of Finance is going to take any action against the <i>Rand Daily Mail.</i> It is going to be very interesting to see if he is going to take any action against Dr. Connie Mulder, because his integrity is at stake now in this issue. Should he fail to take action it will seriously damage his own honour. The hon. the Minister of Finance is duty bound to take some action against the newspaper and Dr. Connie Mulder. No previous Minister of Finance has ever been accused of saying something which is completely untrue. No previous Minister of Finance has ever been treated or slighted in this manner.</p>
<p>So, Sir, I say we cannot continue with a Minister of Finance whose credibility and competence has been completely and utterly destroyed by what has emerged so far. There are questions which remain, questions which are continually going to be asked. Every day new answers come out, but they are not coming from the public; they are emerging from the Government side. It is its own worst enemy. That is why this whole Information scandal is going to go on, and on and on. It is bedevilling the progress and the future of South Africa. It is about time we got finished with it. But, Mr. President, we are not going to get finished with it, because, as I said just now, every time the Minister of Finance opens his mouth, he puts his foot well and truly in it.</p>
<p>I would like to see the end of this whole affair. I would like to see it come to an end. But it is not going to because when the Government relies, as it says it does, on the reports of the Erasmus Commission, I want to say that in my own view—and I believe it is a view which is echoed by most of the people in South Africa—the Erasmus Commission’s credibility is also being destroyed. [Interjections.] Gen. Van den Bergh called it a farce. They did nothing about it, so it must be a farce. I certainly have seen no evidence of the Erasmus Commission. I do not give tuppence for its opinion until I see some evidence. I might then change my mind, Sir, but at the moment we have been told that we must wait until 31 May for the final report of the Erasmus Commission. Mr. President, I am not waiting for it. I do not think it will tell us anything new. The only thing it may leave with us is the everlasting thought that this whole episode, the Erasmus Commission included, has just been an attempt and an effort to cover up for the people who were responsible for what happened in this whole sorry chapter.</p>
<p>I do not believe and I do not believe anybody in South Africa believes that Dr. Connie Mulder is solely and completely responsible for what happened in this matter. There are other members of the Cabinet who were involved to a lesser or greater degree. [Interjections.] The Erasmus Commission even makes that point clear, and the one thing which surprises me about hon. Senators opposite—in fact it is something which shames me—is that they allow a former colleague, a former friend in many instances, to take the rap, to be a scapegoat and they have not got the courage to get up and defend him and say: “No, this is too much, I am not going to allow that to happen.” They have abandoned their friend; their sense of loyalty does not exist. This is what I believe Dr. Connie Mulder has every right to feel sore about He has every right to feel badly treated when hon. Senators on that side of the House—and there are many sitting in this Chamber—who were his close friends and who know that things went wrong, have not got the courage to get up and say: “We cannot see you being treated as a scapegoat and taking the rap entirely for matters for which you were only partly responsible.”</p>

<p>Let me tell that hon. Senator how this whole episode of Mr. Eglin came about. It was because of a statement made by the most undiplomatic diplomat we have ever had in South Africa, Pik Botha. [Interjections.] Yes. He has not produced one ounce of evidence and he cannot produce one ounce of evidence. He gets up and makes a statement, and that statement concerns something he was aware of over a month previously, and it is something he was told about. It is all so much eyewash, a storm in a teacup and an attempt by the Government to draw a big red herring across the path in respect of the whole Information affair. It will not wash. If Mr. Eglin wants to travel around Africa seeing leaders, if he wants to ’phone ambassadors, I say good luck to him. It is time some of the Government members did the same thing.</p>

<p>We are in trouble in South Africa. We have the possibilities of a great future in respect of these last two reports. But can anybody really have confidence in the people who sit in the Government benches? I cannot have that confidence, Mr. President. It was that same Cabinet, Sir, that sent us into Angola illegally. [Interjections.] That same Cabinet, I say, sent us into Angola completely illegally, against our constitution, and our troops were killed. I have no confidence that they will come to the right decisions. And what happens day after day in this Information affair? More and more information is revealed through different sources: so how in heaven’s name can anybody have confidence in them? [Interjections.]</p>

They are entitled to it, but what does this great Nationalist Party do when it is under pressure in this Chamber? It outnumbers the Opposition four to one. But because it is frightened to face a debate across the floor of this House it storms out like meek little mice. This great Nationalist Party cannot face nine members of the Opposition! It goes out because it cannot face the truth. Then it stops further debate by moving the suspension of Standing Order NO. 31.

<p>I am not wasting the time of that hon. Senator. He can leave this Chamber any time he likes like he did last week. What is happening in South Africa today—no matter what happens at Swellendam and Beaufort West—is that when one mentions the names of Cabinet Ministers, the people pass snide remarks; they giggle; they joke. The people have no confidence in the Government of South Africa. In fact, there is no trust in the Government of South Africa. Since a Minister told a lie in the Other Place I question every answer I get from a Cabinet Minister wondering whether I am also being told a lie. [Interjections.] I don’t know what that hon. Senator is saying. [Interjections.] Yes, I just brush it aside.</p>
<p>I want to conclude my remarks this afternoon, Sir, by again saying to the hon. the Minister of Finance—I do not know what called him away; it will be a happy day when he is called away permanently to take up some other occupation—that the public of South Africa are entitled to the right answers from him, unambiguous answers. The public does not believe that it is going to get those answers from any Erasmus Commission but that it will get those answers only from an open court where the hon. the Minister of Finance and others can be subjected to cross-examination. That is what the public demands and until that happens the Information scandal will go on and on and damage South Africa’s name and its progress even more. What has to happen in South Africa is that the hon. the Minister of Finance has to subject himself to open debate and cross-examination. That is the only way in which this Information scandal will be checked; the only way in which it will be stopped. When he makes remarks as he did in the Other Place about compromising photographs of Dr. Mulder that are in the hands of the <i>Rand Daily Mail</i> he is as much as insinuating that the <i>Rand Daily Mail</i> has blackmailed Dr. Connie Mulder. Then the hon. the Minister of Finance fails to take any further action in that regard. I believe that he will be failing in his duty as an ordinary citizen of South Africa if he does not act. Protests are not good enough. Saying that he will give evidence before the Erasmus Commission is not good enough. The hon. the Minister of Finance must at this late hour give evidence so that the public can see that justice is seen to be done. Nothing else will suffice; nothing else will restore the confidence of the South African public in this particular Minister of Finance. To talk of vendettas and that sort of thing is absolute nonsense. The hon. the Minister of Finance knows it and every hon. Senator on the Government side knows it as well. So if we want to end this Information scandal—not a so-called scandal as one of the hon. Senators on the other side said it was but a real and terrible scandal in our South African political history—the easiest way to do so is for the hon. the Minister of Finance to get up and to say that he resigns. That is the way to end it quickly. If he does not want to do it that way, if he still believes that he has acted correctly at all times then I say he must subject himself to open cross-examination so that justice can be seen to be done. If he does not do that, Sir, then I and all the people in South Africa will be entitled to say that although we have a Minister of Finance who is honest, who personally gained nothing from what took place which led to the Information scandal, we nevertheless have never had a more incompetent Minister of Finance in our history. I hope that we never do. If the hon. the Minister of Finance does not resign he will be lowering the status of our governing system in South Africa. He will be lowering it for all time because he will have established a new norm; he will have established an acceptance of the fact that when a Minister of State finds that things go wrong in his department—or does not know that things have gone wrong in his department—he does nothing about it but rides it out saying “It has nothing to do with me even though I signed documents without making sure what I was signing.” If that Minister continues to hold office he will be creating a precedent in South African politics which can do us nothing but harm for all time.</p>

<p>Mr. President, the hon. Senator who has just resumed his seat reminded me of a story told to me by a friend. Two Americans in one of the big cities of the United States of America were listening to a soap-box orator who was pleading a certain cause. Having listened to him for a few moments the one asked the other: “Jack, what is that guy saying?” His friend replied: “No, John he ain’t saying.” That is the type of speech we have so often from the hon. Senator Winchester. Many of the aspects raised by him have already been replied to. I may return to that during the course of my speech.</p>
<p>As far as I am concerned, Mr. President, the choicest of the tastiest NP dishes have already been served to us during the past two days. There is not much left to be dished up. What is left in the pot I shall personally try to present to the House in the calm manner in which I usually speak.</p>
<p>In order to prevent my prepared speech from being too much of a repetition of what other hon. Senators have already said, I shall have to cut out many of the facts. But in order to retain the logical sequence of my arguments I shall, without going into the reasons why certain subjects have been raised, just refer to them so as to retain the logical flow of what I have to say. In this connection I have the following matters in mind: Mr. President, I agree with previous speakers that the unsavoury attack on the hon. the Minister of Finance is nothing but a futile merry-go-round exercise of an uncomparably dubious standard. One cannot get away from that, Sir. Furthermore, it is a charge against the Erasmus Commission in whose impartiality hon. Senators opposite have no confidence, while those same people refuse to testify under oath before that commission. Nobody has ever prevented them from doing so. Now they give the impression that they have to be asked to testify, …</p>

<speech by="#fick">
<from>*Senator <person refersto="hansard">J. J. FICK</person>:</from>
<p>… that they have to be begged to testify. If they are in fact so seriously and deeply concerned about the state of affairs in South Africa that the commission is investigating, one would have thought that their patriotism would have compelled them to inform the commission of the things they merely hint at in this House— and prove them to be true by giving evidence. Why do they not do that? We have not as yet had a reply to that question. The next question one asks oneself is why these hon. friends do not wait until the Erasmus Commission has brought out its final report. In view of these facts can they blame speakers on this side of the House for coming to the conclusion that the sustained attacks on the person of the hon. Senator Horwood flow from a desire they have nurtured to denounce him as a dishonourable weakling because of a personal political step taken by him? The hon. Senator Winchester alleged a few moments ago that the hon. the Minister had lost credibility in the eyes of the people, that he should resign and so forth. Reference has been made to the speech made in Johannesburg by one of the greatest men South Africa has ever produced, namely, Dr. Anton Rupert. My hon. friend will forgive me if, in reply to what the hon. Senator Winchester said yesterday, I just add something that Dr. Rupert said but which my hon. friend did not quote. Dr. Rupert said that the hon. Senator Owen Horwood had become the target of personal attacks by the logical successors of Cecil John Rhodes and those who want to gain control of South Africa by financing “political parties and newspapers”. Those were the words he omitted.</p>
<p>That surprising speech by Dr. Rupert reflects, according to <i>Die</i> <i>Burger</i> “the general support that he received there from more than 600 of the delegates”. Strong disapproval was expressed at that meeting of the attempt to implicate the hon. the Minister of Finance in this Information debacle and to present him in a dishonourable light. The congress and leading businessmen from all over the country loudly acclaimed Dr. Rupert’s motion of appreciation and it was unanimously adopted. That is a completely different picture from the one a person would form if he did not know the hon. Senator Winchester. I should like to read something else that Dr. Rupert said. He said—</p>
<block name="quote">Ek het spesiaal hulde betoon teenoor die Minister van Finansies, Senator Horwood, omdat hy deur sy begroting getoon het dat hy die besondere belang van private inisiatief erken het. Hy het die land deur ’n diep drif gedra.</block>
<p>He also made other remarks that have already been quoted here. He pointed out that the people who were behaving in that manner towards the hon. Senator Horwood, were the logical successors of those who took the diamond fields of the Free State, those who wanted to annex the Transvaal because of its gold and those who wanted to govern our country by financing political parties and newspapers. He could very well have added those whom one has in fact to beg to disclose the names of the shareholders, and to tell one who the people are who have most say, those faceless people behind some of the English-language newspapers. He said further—</p>
<block name="quote">Hulle mag ook teen my vergelding soek, maar ek het meer waardering vir lojaliteit as vir geld. Daar is reeds tekens dat hulle dit teen die Afrikaner “establishment” soek.</block>
<p>That was what Dr. Anton Rupert said. I agree because that is quite clear. If there is this antipathy towards a Minister, an English-speaking South African, for having joined the National Party, the only reason must be that he has sided with the Afrikaner “establishment”. However, I do not want to quarrel about that any further but one has to react to what the previous speaker has said.</p>
<p>A great fuss has been made of the incident last Thursday when the Government members in the Senate walked out. The Opposition speakers have labelled that walk-out as an NP violation of their democratic rights. The hon. Senator Horak dealt with that at length.</p>

<p>No, that is my interpretation. The hon. Senator did not personally use those words. However, I would be violating my conscience if I did not tell hon. Senators that I personally walked out because my whole being cried out in protest against the obviously senseless cacophony of hollow tirade that was once again being directed at a person who had already been declared innocent juridically and that while there were more important and more serious national matters that needed our attention time was being wasted so that attention could be distracted from the weakness of and lack of policy on the part of the Opposition. Sir, let us remember one thing. This is a psychological fact and hon. Senators must not forget it. A certain type of person who is petty, nondescript and who has never achieved anything, will sometimes attack and criticize someone who is bigger and more famous than himself in an attempt to enhance his own personality and to attract public attention. The Opposition must be careful that that psychological judgment is not passed on them. However, there is one bright spot discernible in our differences. It would appear that we agree on and are happy about one incident, namely, that Margaret Thatcher is now the Prime Minister of Great Britain. We are very pleased about that.</p>
<p>I think an additional objective of the budget debate is to try to obtain a political profile of the actions and the principles of the various political parties that are represented in this House. We have been told today that the Information debacle has fallen like manna into the lap of the two declining Opposition parties, something they have been exploiting over the past weeks and months in an attempt to divert the attention of the electorate from their pitiful lack of a political policy that will be acceptable to the general public in a multinational country like South Africa.</p>

Their majority there was over 100% more than on the previous occasion.

<p>No, it was uncle Niklaas who said that; I am merely echoing him. The Opposition should not try to belittle this result.</p>
<p>Mr. President, that reminds me of the history of the former UP when the Young Turks were making such progress and when a few of them won seats in the Johannesburg municipal elections. Shortly after that the NP suffered a setback at a by-election. Sir, you should have seen them when they arrived here! They looked as pleased as Punch and they told us that the NP was finished. The NP bided its time, it spoke nicely to its members and then there was a by-election at Oudtshoorn. What happened then? The Opposition collapsed completely and left with their tail between their legs. We warned them that that would happen; we warned them that the electorate would realize that the exaggerated actions of the Opposition in that connection were only an attempt to hide the poverty-stricken state of their policy. They did not want to believe that. Now they have seen the writing on the wall; thus it has been proved comprehensively and conclusively. We are not quarrelling with them. An additional objective is to evaluate the political profile of the political parties in this House.</p>
<p>Mr. President, let me put it another way. My friends opposite must admit that, in the past, they have shamefully underestimated the intelligence of the electorate. Now they have done so once again. That was why, like the HNP, they tried in a pamphlet to represent the Information affair to the public as a dreadful spectre that had enveloped the entire Government in its fetid shroud. The Twelve Apostles: One turned traitor and they now give to understand that the eleven who remained faithful were also traitors. At that time it was thought that the principles to which He subscribed would disappear! But the principles of Him of whom I speak still live. One would never want to compare oneself with the Man from Nazareth. But one should remember that age-old lesson in the political situation that has been created by the Information debacle. The sins or the mistake of one do not tarnish all. One should take note, however, of the manner in which action has been taken against the person or persons who are guilty. The way it was done in the past cannot be improved upon and all praise is due to the hon. the Prime Minister when we say that.</p>
<p>Mr. President, it is remarkable—once again we have to deal with this—how difficult the respective Opposition parties have found it this year to discuss their policies. Surely the man who loves his wife and finds her beautiful is proud of her. He wants other people to notice her. That makes him feel ten feet tall.</p>

<p>Are we not discussing your bits and pieces policy? I am sorry that the hon. PFP Senator is not here today. The Opposition has little to say about its policy as such.</p>
<p>Until recently the same PFP whose candidate lost his deposit at Swellendam, still accepted the system of a qualified franchise and thought that it could be successfully applied in South Africa. And now? What do they think now? They must tell us because there has been a congress in Durban in the meantime. Last year they at least went so far—after the NP had long since emphasized it—as to admit that this country of ours was in fact made up of many nationalities. But we have as yet not been able to obtain any agreement on policy from them. It was a relief to them when they found something in the Information debacle, by way of boastful speeches, to present to their congress instead of analysing their policy to the very core and finding unanimity in that regard.</p>
<p>I want to address myself in particular to the hon. the Leader of the NRP in this House. The NRP are still denying vociferously that the difference between their policy and that of the PFP is only a matter of degree while the end result of the political thinking of both parties will inevitably lead to a Black majority government, the policies of both of them. It will simply be more gradual in the case of the NRP than in the case of the PFP. If the NRP Senators deny that, we would welcome the reasons for such denial in this House. We shall be pleased. The hon. Senator Horak promised Dr. A. P. Treurnicht in a previous debate that he would let him have a written policy statement. I too would like to have a copy. But remember one thing—</p>
<block name="quote">Vermy tog ’n middeweg-politiek<br/>wees tog een maal spesifiek<br/>van vaagheid is die volk al siek<br/>kom tot helder polemiek,</block>
<p>but let us have clarity. Tell us what the position is and what the difference is between the NRP and the PFP, if there is any marked difference. [Interjections.] I maintain that the difference is only a question of degree. We would like to have an explanation in this connection.</p>
<p>In September 1976 Sir De Villiers Graaff took the initiative in trying to formulate a broader based effective policy to save the Opposition. Do you remember, Sir? The special steering committee consisting of Messrs. Graaff, Eglin and Gerdener, under the chairmanship of former judge Kowie Marais announced a set of 14 principles. The UP accepted those principles in January 1977; those were not the so-called six principles but the 14 Kowie Marais principles, and today he is a member of the PFP. The six members of Parliament who objected were suspended and they then formed the SAP. Surely they represent the true old UP blood, not so? Or what is the position? The NRP should help us so that we can understand the position. The remaining group …</p>

<block name="quote">… we are not simply the UP under another name …</block>
<p>In other words, he dissociated himself from the idea that his party was simply a successor to the old UP. In a subsequent speech in May this year he again said that he subscribed to the 14 principles of Mr. Kowie Marais. What must one believe, Sir? Must one believe what he said on the last occasion or what he said last year? He is the leader of the party, is he not? We do not understand the position.</p>
<p>But, Sir, do the Progs not subscribe to the same principles? Surely that makes them brothers, close brothers of the NRP. That is why I say the difference between the two parties is only a question of degree. What is the difference?</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the hon. Senator Winchester is not here at the moment and I wanted to ask him what their latest policy was and whether they had reached unanimity on their policy. Is it the policy of the Schwarz group or that of the Suzman group that is in the lead at the moment, or who’s policy? At the same time the hon. Senator Winchester should also tell us why they are opposed to the principle of secret projects in the Department of Information while they are as silent as the grave in regard to Press secrecy in regard to who the owners and shareholders of certain newspapers are. Surely that is illogical, Sir. What is the latest news about the special friendship between their leader, Mr. Don Eglin and Mr. Colin McHenry …? Oh, I mean, Mr. Colin Eglin and Mr. Don McHenry? What is the latest news? We don’t hear anything. What developments are there in respect of the mutually confidential whispering about a leadership crisis in their party? The newspapers have already been fairly open about that. And when the lightning-conductor, the Information affair, is no longer there, will the deep-seated policy differences once again flare up? Whom does Mr. McHenry recommend at the moment as Leader in the place of Mr. Colin Eglin? We should like to know that. Will we shortly read a newspaper headline, as we did at the time in the case of Sir De Villiers Graaff: “Thirteen reasons why Eglin should go?” Or, bearing in mind the 14 principles of Kowie Marais, will it be this time: “Fourteen reasons why Eglin should go?”</p>
<p>Mr. President, the PFP should indulge in some self-analysis and we shall then find that there is a more serious reason for their leadership crisis than dissatisfaction with Mr. Eglin’s helplessness and the unpatriotic McHenry telephone episode or debacle. There is a more serious reason, Sir, and that is that their leader personally validates the accusation that the actions of some of his followers cannot be reconciled with true South African patriotism. They cannot! He has become the symbol of that accusation and that is why they demand today that “he must go”. Mr. President, let me say today that I deprecate the actions of those two people who shot at the flat of Mr. Eglin. I trust that they did not in fact aim at him personally. Apart from the fact that I do not wish him dead on purely humanitarian grounds, I am also pleased that they missed him for a political reason. A live Mr. Eglin as leader of the PFP is the most valuable asset of and best guarantee for its future that the NP and its flourishing future can wish for.</p>

<p>Mr. President I want to conclude on a much more serious note and make the following few serious remarks. I want to ask my friends opposite whether it is not possible for our White political parties to work together towards a more relatively feasible concept of White solidarity in respect of the exceedingly serious and important problems of our fatherland and the interests of its peoples? What I mean is this: In the face of heavy pressure and assaults from so many quarters on South Africa, while admitting that there are certain different political points of view and in spite of them, cannot we at least continue to prove to one another our undisguised loyalty to South Africa and the loyalty of White towards White? Sir, I want to give one example. We can at least display that measure of White unity when we speak or negotiate with Black groups, so that the one political party will not demean the other party, especially the Government, or represent it as being cruel, unfair and so forth, in the eyes of that Black man. We must create the impression in the mind of the Black man that although we differ in our approach and as to the methods to be employed, we as White parties are all honestly seeking their salvation just as we are seeking the salvation of the Whites. We should at least display White solidarity in that circumscribed sense of the word in our attitude towards one another and towards those of a different colour. It is necessary that we do so in the interests of the future of our country; our future demands that. We can and must deliberately aim at and attain that ideal if we are all true patriots and are true to our forebears and our race, because that is not racism, that is nationalism.</p>
<p>In this connection I just want to mention a few aspects in respect of which, I think, it is extremely urgent that we show that unanimity. There is, in the first place, the new Constitution and the negotiations in that regard; secondly, the urgent investigation into the consolidation of the Black states; thirdly, a new phase for the urban Blacks; fourthly, establishing fresh confidence in our economy; fifthly, the physical defence of South Africa; sixthly, loyalty and co-operation in respect of the energy crisis; seventhly, the implementation of the principles contained in the Wiehahn report in the labour field—in that regard we have to have unanimity—and, eighthly, South Africa’s interests in connection with South West Africa and Rhodesia and many other things. What is of the utmost importance, however, is cooperation in implementing the praiseworthy intention of the hon. the Prime Minister, Mr. P. W. Botha, to establish an association or constellation of Southern African states. The role that the West and especially the role that the United States of America is playing in Africa, stresses the absolute necessity of very urgent and determined action in this connection, action in respect of which, I believe, every racial group in our country is entitled to and expects the White political parties to agree and to co-operate. South Africa’s salvation does not lie with any of the countries I have mentioned. Our fate is in our own hands, except of course, in the final instance where our fate as Christians lies in the hands of God. But God always works through an interdiary. He uses a person; He wants us to water the seeds of Christianity and civilization that have been sown here. We are of Africa and we should concern ourselves less with what countries like Great Britain and others say. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>Mr. President, I do enjoy listening to the language of the hon. Senator Fick It is undoubtedly true that he is well-versed in the Afrikaans language. But if I were so well-versed in the Afrikaans language, I would put it to far better use than he did here today.</p>
<p>I want to reply briefly to what the hon. Senator Fick had to say. He spoke of the incident last week when the hon. Senators on the Government side walked out, and he also referred to the Information debacle. But these are not matters I want to speak on this afternoon, though I should like to point out that the blame for the fact that this debate on the Information question has taken place rests foursquare on the shoulders of the NP. I think the hon. Senator Fick will know the saying: “Pity those who are the cause of it”</p>

<from>*Senator <person refersto="hansard">J. C. MOLL</person>:</from>
<p>Mr. President, we have not acted incorrectly; we were not the cause of this thing. And let me say this, Sir. The NP is keeping the flames of the Information scandal burning by making piecemeal disclosures of the secret projects which does no credit to them or South Africa. Whenever a new disclosure is made, we are blamed for talking about it.</p>
<p>The hon. Senator spoke about our policy, but I want to put the following question to him: What did the NP say to the voters of South Africa before the 1977 election? They asked the voters to vote for the new dispensation, the new policy of the NP. And what was this policy, Sir? Was it crystal clear and obvious as the hon. Senator has said? Or was it vague? What did he know about it himself? The public of South Africa were asked to vote for it, but they did not know what they were voting for. Even at this stage nobody in South Africa knows what the real policy is. Now the proposals have been submitted to a select committee. [Interjections.] No, I am speaking of this policy, and it is a very important one. It might be a step in the right direction but there is no clarity in regard to it.</p>
<p>I just want to reply briefly to what the hon. Senator De Jager said here this afternoon …</p>

<p>Talk about Swellendam.</p>
</speech>
<speech by="#moll">
<from>*Senator <person refersto="hansard">J. C. MOLL</person>:</from>
<p>Let me tell that hon. Senator that there will be other elections we can talk about, but I feel particularly happy about Swellendam. That hon. Senator did not think we would get 2 640 votes. He said beforehand we would not even get 2 000, and now that hon. Senator is not so proud of Swellendam. [Interjections.] Yes, they won, but he is not so proud of it They are trying to make much of it, but it is not true that they are really pleased about the result.</p>
<p>The hon. Senator De Jager said that the NP worked and voted for South Africa. I think if that is his opinion, then it is his opinion, but he must please not arrogate that conviction and that work and the facts he has mentioned. I challenge anybody here to point a finger at this young party of mine, or at me who first belonged to another party, or even at that party, and say that we did not at all times and for many years work and vote for South Africa. None of those people on the other side could ever blame us for that in the past or will ever be able to reproach us for it in the future, viz. that we and our party are not for South Africa.</p>
<p>The hon. Senator De Jager pleaded for the expansion of the sugar industry and, as he put it, for the specific purpose of manufacturing fuel. I want to tell him that before this project is undertaken there must be thorough re search. At the moment there is an overproduction of sugar throughout the world. The price of sugar in other parts of the world is very low. That is one of the reasons why we have to pay so much for sugar here in South Africa. The fact is that sugar farmers in South Africa may not produce their full quota; they may only produce 82% of their quota and the remainder has to remain on the lands. Moreover, the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs has said that we must not use food to produce energy but that we must use energy to produce food.</p>
<p>The hon. Senator Van Schoor said, <i>inter alia</i>, this afternoon that when the law regarding trade unions is changed, the other races in South Africa will have to show a sense of responsibility. Allow me, Sir, to show here this afternoon how the Black people feel about this. I am going to talk of the specific area I come from. The Black people in the Black towns outside the growth point of Newcastle, e.g. the Black towns of Madadene and Isizweni and the whole complex there, have already shown a great sense of responsibility and that, Sir, before they were told, as the hon. Senator now seeks to tell them, almost threaten them, that if we change the law they must show more responsibility. I want to show the hon. House how very responsible those people have been. An Iscor factory was erected at Newcastle and it has become a growth point. It was erected in implementation of the Government’s policy of decentralization. As a result many of these Black people have been attracted to the Black towns around Newcastle. It is obvious that where growth points are established, workers will be attracted to them. In the past when housing rentals or bus fares have been increased, there have been unpleasant incidents. There have even been strikes. I remember that a few years ago one of my own vehicles was stoned. The people were particularly upset at the increases.</p>
<p>But this year the housing rentals in these Black towns were raised from R8 and R10 a month to R18 a month. This happened in January this year. In spite of the fact that the housing rentals were increased by 120%, nobody heard a word about it. It did not even appear in the newspapers. The Black people did not kick against it. They showed a sense of responsibility and accepted it. Where there was trouble in the past when bus fares were increased by 10%, this year bus fares in Newcastle were raised by from 29% to 69%, depending on the routes, and the Black people of those towns accepted it. Sir, can you imagine what it means to these people to have to pay these extra fares? These facts together with the fact that there is unemployment at Newcastle and that there is a housing shortage, leads one to the conclusion that these people and their leaders are responsible people. What can it be attributed to? I attribute it to the leaders of these Zulus in that area, the council members of their municipal associations and even the mayor. These people have control over their voters in those residential areas. They exercise control and therefore we, as Whites in South Africa, must be grateful. We should realize that we are dealing here with responsible people. When one thinks about it, one must also realize how free those people are from communist influences, how free they must be from instigators in their midst. Let us take note of the fact that those people are responsible.</p>
<p>A new direction has been taken at the moment in these Black areas round Newcastle; there is co-ordination and those people are taking a definite direction. Having shown how responsibly those people have acted, Sir, I think we should make it easier for them to continue in that way. We must create the opportunities for them to change their way of life, or rather, to improve it, so that they can be proud and happy citizens of this country. If we create these opportunities for them, that will be the best counter to communism in South Africa. If these people are happy and if we can make them happy, not by concessions but by real changes in South Africa, then we can say that we really have contributed something to the welfare of this country.</p>
<p>I think we all admit that it is difficult to put South Africa’s case abroad. When we look at the Wiehahn report and at the Riekert report, I must say that we on this side of the House welcome them. This is something South Africa has been waiting for. This is something which will benefit South Africa. When these recommendations are implemented, it will be that much easier to put South Africa’s case abroad. Implement these recommendations, do away with job reservation. This will not only be to our benefit overseas but it will also be good for us in South Africa. When it is good for us here in South Africa, then the world outside will not be able to point a finger at us. If all our people in South Africa can be satisfied, then the world outside will realize that things are going well in this country.</p>
<p>For that reason we welcome these recommendations. Dr. Piet Riekert said on television the other evening that if the proposals contained in the two reports could be implemented, it would contribute to a greater extent to the removal of friction among the various race groups. I do not want to be so petty as to say that this is really an admission that friction exists. We do know there is friction. But I do accept that if these recommendations are implemented, they will remove friction.</p>
<p>He also said it would lead to a new era in race relations. It will lead to the inflow of capital from overseas. The important point is that we will make it easier for these people, who in reality are so loyal to South Africa, to remain loyal. The other day the hon. the Minister of Community Development said in the Other Place that he had R760 million available for the construction of houses up to 1982. I am pleased to hear that and we welcome it. But may I say that it is not nearly enough. In the Madadene/Blauwbos complex at the moment there are 23 000 houses. If we accept that an average of 10 people or two families live in each house, this means a population of 230 000 people. At the moment as a result of research which the Zulu Development Corporation has done, it is accepted that at least 250 000 people live in that area. If we want to accommodate 250 000 people, it means that by the year 1982—the year the hon. the Minister of Community Development mentioned—there will be a shortage of 45 000 houses. If each unit costs R3 000, we will find that it will cost approxi mately R150 million to provide housing for one small group of people at the growth point of Newcastle. For that reason I say that we shall need a lot more money.</p>
<p>The recommendations in the two reports in fact give us the chance of making friends of these people. But we must do more. We must provide job opportunities and housing for them. This must follow on these recommendations.</p>
<p>Sir, there are other suggestions I could make. The Zulu Development Corporation together with the Economic Development Corporation could, for instance, make more money available for businesses. The Zulu Development Corporation can only assist in settling up retail businesses. The time has come when more industries should be channelled to this growth point.</p>

<p>Mr. President, I intend speaking for only a short while this evening and, with your permission, I shall have more to say next Tuesday.</p>
<p>We have of course now come to the end of the debate on the budget motion. I think the debate lasted ten hours. A number of useful, constructive and valuable contributions were made during the course of the debate, for which one is very grateful. These also came from the Opposition side and I shall refer to them again. I just want to say that it is nonetheless regrettable that the atmosphere of this dignified and famous Upper House should once again have been polluted as the result of a few contributions which in my view should really not have been made here.</p>
<p>Mr. President, during the debate on this motion two very important incidents occurred. I refer to the election results at Swellendam and Beaufort West The significance of the election results—at Swellendam the NP obtained a majority of 4 000 votes and at Beaufort West almost 3 500 with percentage polls of more than 80% at Swellendam and upwards of 70% at Beaufort West—is a highlight in our present political life. Much will still be said about these two results. Even if circumstances had been quite normal and there had not been such an awful witchhunt on the Information affair and so many accusations made against this Government every day, these would still have been outstanding results. What does it mean when one relates it to everything that has been said? There were cries that the Government should resign and hold an election immediately. For how long were we not told that? Since November, every month we have been told that we must go to the country, because then we would see what the voters thought of us. And, Sir, what are these if not elections? What are these if not annihilating results for the Opposition parties? I maintain, and I do not think it can be denied, that as far as the PFP is concerned—the hon. Senator Winchester, apparently, while I was holding a discussion, attacked me once again, but that makes no impression on me. However, I am sorry that he is not here because I should like to have spoken to him for a minute or two about this …</p>

<p>Sir, I appreciate the contributions of hon. Senators on the other side of the House, <i>inter alia</i>, those of the hon. Senators Horak, Bozas, Scheepers and Moll. I listened carefully to their speeches and they really made an effort to speak objectively on our economic and financial policy and similar matters. They did in fact make contributions to which one could listen.</p>
<p>The hon. Senator Dr. Scheepers spoke mainly on labour matters. She is undoubtedly most competent and qualified to speak in that field. I listened therefore with great interest to her and I can give her the assurance that we shall give attention to what she had to say. On a later occasion we shall have a lot to say about this because the implications and the results of the Wiehahn and Riekert reports are of great importance to our country and we will have to give them our full attention. I want to thank her for her contribution.</p>
<p>†Mr. President, when I first came to this hon. House we had on the Opposition benches the hon. Senator Norman Eaton, who regrettably is no longer with us. But whenever I had to speak in a debate in which he took part—and I happened to check this not so long ago out of interest in some of the older Hansards—I invariably found myself congratulating or complimenting him on the way he had conducted his debating. The hon. Senator Dr. Scheepers is following in his footsteps. It is not a question of whether we agree with her, or whether we agreed with everything the hon. Senator Eaton said. But, Sir, the hon. Senator Eaton was to me a shining example of a man who put his party’s views clearly and courageously. He stood by what he said, he was prepared to listen to the opposite views, and could make a very fair judgement. He also enjoyed the greatest respect in this hon. House.</p>
<p>*Sir, in the minute left to me I want to thank hon. Senators on this side of the House who participated in the debate most heartily for their contributions. It so happens that neither the hon. Senator Crook nor the hon. Senator Webber nor the hon. Senator Winchester, who once again made all sorts of allegations in connection with the Information matter, is in his seat at the moment. I am tempted, therefore, to ignore them. In any event, I think that especially since the hon. Senator Klopper and my colleague, the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs, dealt with them yesterday, they have been completely destroyed.</p>
<p>In accordance with Standing Order No. 22, the House adjourned at <recordedtime time="1979-05-10T18:00:00"></recordedtime>18h00.</p>
