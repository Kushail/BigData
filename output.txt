('TUESDAY, 8 MAY 1979', 'ESTIMATE OF EXPENDITURE, 1979-’80', '[<p>Mr. President, when this debate was adjourned on Thursday, prior to the Great Escape by Government Senators, including the hon. the Minister of Finance, I had commented on a remark made by the hon. the Minister of Finance that Government spending was well under control.</p>, <p>I hope that the hon. the Minister’s statement can be applied to all aspects of Government spending and not only in respect of the increase in the rate of Government spending. It should also include the prevention of the misappropriation of public funds in future on projects similar to the recent Information scandal. Some revelations which have been made recently and for which I believe satisfactory explanations and replies have not been given have made it plain that there were certain expenses in the past which have as yet not been fully explained to the public of South Africa or to this House or the Other Place. Among others, I am referring here to certain expenditure in respect of a weekly magazine called <i>To The Point</i> which was recently revealed. This is something of which we were not aware until it was revealed recently, first of all by Dr. Connie Mulder and then the subsequent acknowledgment of the expenditure of an amount of some R14 million on this project by the hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs. It is therefore all the more regrettable that when the hon. the Minister and his colleagues were given the opportunity last Thursday to discuss and to clarify this matter, they saw fit to leave this Chamber. There are several conclusions one can draw from this, but I think the most important one is that Government Senators could neither defend nor explain the facts exposed by the latest revelations and that was why they left the Chamber.</p>, <p>May I put a question to the hon. Senator? Did the hon. Senator not ask me in my office which Orders of the Day would be taken on that day? When I discussed this with him was he not satisfied?</p>, <p>I was satisfied with the Orders of the Day, Mr. President, but I was not satisfied with the reaction of Senators on the Government side.</p>, <p>†The Order Paper had nothing to do with this at all. It is completely irrelevant. As far as the hon. Senator Gouws is concerned I can only say that he probably made his greatest contribution to the debates of this session by walking out, because if this is the sort of contribution he makes in a debate as Chief Whip of the Government side, he can just as well leave it.</p>, <p>To come back to the walk-out, I want to say to Government Senators that, rather than defend their case, something they owe the voters of South Africa because they have to defend Government actions …</p>, <p>Everything <i>ad nauseam</i>!</p>, <p><i>Ad nauseam</i>? I am sorry if they see it that way, but if that is so then it is not my fault. It is the fault of the Government that this Information scandal is dragging on and on. If it is a case of raising the matter here <i>ad nauseam</i>, then the hon. the Minister must shoulder his part of the responsibility for it. Instead of facing the music, as the saying goes, they chose another old proverb, viz. to show a clean pair of heels. Then, as the saying goes, they chose the lesser of two evils and in this case decided that discretion was the better part of valour.</p>, <p>Tell us about the vendetta.</p>, <p>Which vendetta? This is something about the hon. the Minister which is rather interesting. I have never met anybody in my life who claims to have so many vendettas being carried on against him as this hon. Minister. It is not only the hon. Senator Crook; it is also the <i>Rand Daily Mail</i>, and now it seems as if Dr. Connie Mulder has a vendetta against the hon. the Minister as well. You know, Sir, in psychological jargon they refer to something called a persecution complex, and I think the hon. the Minister should really take stock of himself and answer this question for himself when he is alone. Does he not suffer from something of that nature?</p>, <p>He has answered it to the Erasmus Commission.</p>, <p>To the Erasmus Commission? What has he answered to the Erasmus Commission? You know, that hon. Senator sitting at the back there seems to be hard of hearing sometimes. What has he answered to the Erasmus Commission? [Interjections.] But I shall tell the hon. the Minister and the Government Senators on the other side that by running away … [Interjections.] … by running away the Info scandal will not go away. It is going to stick to them like their shadow until such time as they come clean and they give us all the evidence concerned. [Interjections.]</p>, <p>I say, Sir, that more and more suspicions are aroused in the minds of more and more people and more and more questions are asked to which fewer and fewer answers are given. I maintain that until such time as everything is properly cleared up, confidence in South Africa’s economy and its future will not be properly restored. I make that claim. Walk-outs contribute nothing to restoring that necessary confidence. Open and genuine debating, on the contrary, will do so. I am not alone in this sort of conviction, Mr. President. Had this hon. Senator been able to read, I could have shown him the second leader in <i>Die Beeld</i> on Monday. <i>Die Beeld</i> in its second leader condemned Government Senators for this sort of action. It told them straight that that solved nothing and, if anything, that they had harmed the dignity of this hon. House more than the sort of vendetta they claim is being waged on the part of the hon. Senator Crook. The hon. Senator Gouws should read that leader.</p>, <p>*I want to return now to the speech of the hon. the Minister of Finance. [Interjections.] Yes, I can see the hon. the Minister is relieved, very much relieved; he even has a smile on his face. For the first time in a very long time I see he is smiling again.</p>, <p>You can talk on any subject you choose.</p>, <p>Yes, Sir, I shall talk about anything I choose, and that is why I want to come to the speech of the hon. the Minister now. At this stage, Mr. President, I wish to ask for the privilege of the hour.</p>, <p>The hon. the Minister of Finance referred indirectly in his speech to certain factors which indicated that confidence in the continued growth of our economy had not been completely restored. That is why I said in my introductory remarks on Thursday that creating a spirit of optimism was not the sole aim of a budget of this kind. But the continuation of that spirit of optimism and the maintenance of its momentum, I think, is the task, more than anything else, of the hon. the Minister of Finance and his department.</p>, <p>I say the hon. the Minister referred to the fact that confidence in our economy had not been completely restored. To which factor did he refer as being the most important? He said that a decline in fixed investment and a decline in the level of supplies had become apparent during the past year. He also referred to the fact that the latest increase in the growth rate had taken place mainly as a result of two factors, the first of which was an increase in the value of exports, and the second an increase in the value of gold production.</p>, <p>He said further that there was an increase in unemployment, which indicated that particularly the secondary sectors of our economy were still not on the road to growth. That is why I think it is necessary for one to look at the incentives which the hon. the Minister announced in his budget as well as in his speech in this hon. House to see whether when considered in the light of less favourable tendencies they will have the desired results, the effects the hon. the Minister is looking for in the promotion of growth. I think one must evaluate these factors.</p>, <p>I want to say to the hon. the Minister that he and I have agreed for many years in regard to one aspect. This is an objective for which I have pleaded during the last two or three budgets, namely that one must try to establish growth in the private sector by the encouragement of increased consumer spending. This is a very important factor, Sir. We agree on this one point. As the hon. the Minister has now made this the main object of his budget. I want to go into it. But before I do so, I just want to say that the hon. the Minister might be too late with this idea. In a previous speech I referred to the fact that the curbing of growth in one’s economy is something which later becomes chronic in the economy and feeds upon itself. It becomes a vicious circle in which one factor influences the other. Because of decreased investment there are fewer job opportunities and because of fewer job opportunities there is less money to spend in the form of consumer spending. As a result of the decrease in money for spending one has less investment. That is why I think we should look at the ways and means which the hon. Minister is bringing into play to establish growth. We have had a variety of these methods. In February we had the repayment of a loan levy. Public Service salaries have been increased; in the last budget certain tax concessions were made and then we also found for the first time in a long time that the hon. the Minister had budgeted for a deficit, something else which should have a stimulatory effect.</p>, <p>In regard to increased salaries and tax concessions I want to say that these incentives will make themselves felt over a period of a year. It is not an immediate injection into the economy. It is an injection which is only felt after a period of a year. Even so far as the Minister’s deficit budget and through it the creation of more money and more quasi-money, is concerned, this will only become apparent after a year. Because it will only take place after the lapse of one year, the influence on our economy will be less noticeable than the hon. the Minister might think. I think that in the position we are in at the moment, this is insufficient. I think the hon. the Minister could have done more and that consumer spending needs a good deal more than a mere stimulus, especially to utilize what the hon. the Minister referred to in his speech as reserve capacity. By so doing still more job opportunities can be created.</p>, <p>Apart from these factors there are also adverse factors which will have an effect upon these stimuli which the hon. the Minister has proposed in his budget and which, to a great extent, will neutralize them. I want to mention a few and in the first place</p>, <p>I want to refer to our present rate of inflation. I do not see many signs favourable to a decline in our present inflation rate. The hon. the Minister has told us which factors in the year that has passed he regarded as the factors which had contributed the most to the present unsatisfactory inflation rate. Apart from administered prices, we are not sure whether we will have another fuel price increase during the current year. The hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs, when he was in the Senate and we asked him about this, would give us no definite assurance one way or the other.</p>, <p>He could not.</p>, <p>I realize he could not, and therefore I am mentioning the fact that even after he had levied this extra 6 cents on fuel, he did not see his way to clear to give an assurance that that would be an adequate buffer against further price increased in the year ahead.</p>, <p>I also want to inform the hon. the Minister that if our growth rate is not large enough, we are also faced with the possibility that in the days ahead there will be further increases in Post Office tariffs and South African Railways tariffs. These are inevitable increases which will have to come if our growth rate at that time is not such that the hon. Ministers and the departments responsible for these two service organizations are satisfied that at the end of the year they will be able to carry out their obligations by way of revenue because of greater growth.</p>, <p>I also want to refer to the recent increases and the increases which we expect in the near future in food prices. Here we have a slight shift because food prices have not played an important part in our inflation rate for a long time. But this year we have to face the possibility that they may well play an important role, and perhaps the most important role, in the lives and the incomes of the less-privileged people such as our pensioners. We also have to face, apart from those prices which have already been raised, increases in the price of milk, dairy products, eggs and a multitude of other agricultural products. While one concedes that the farmer in South Africa has no choice at the moment, faced as he is with high production costs, other than to ask for a higher price for his products, nevertheless I want to point out that this will have an important effect on the cost of living in the near future and the year ahead.</p>, <p>We have had other factors which were not mentioned in the budget. I think for instance of the increase in the price of cement. This is something which will contribute to increased building costs and also to increased rentals for those people who pay rent. I mention this, Sir, because I think all these factors will have an inhibiting influence and effect on consumer spending in South Africa. This is the factor on which the hon. the Minister is relying to stimulate growth, particularly in the secondary sector of the economy.</p>, <p>In conclusion, Sir, I want to point out that it is not in my nature to criticize. I want to make certain recommendations to the hon. the Minister to try to rectify matters in this country and to stimulate the economy beyond the present tempo. I think that the hon. the Minister should, in the first place, channel more money than he has appropriated up to the present, to the private sector. He could do this by way of an earlier payment of the longest outstanding loan levy. If that is done, I think he would at once inject a considerable amount of money into the money stream in South Africa, which would give a reasonable stimulus to private spending.</p>, <p>Then I want to suggest to the hon. the Minister that whatever proposals might be made in connection with the taxation of capital gains and fringe benefits should be deferred until such time as he is convinced that the economy is on the road to growth.</p>, <p>Thirdly, I think that notwithstanding what the hon. the Minister has already appropriated for the training and education of people, we shall have to spend a great deal more in this regard in the near future. We do have the recommendations of the Wiehahn Commission, but I do not want to go into details about those recommendations now. I do want to say, however, that that in itself, even if the recommendations are accepted, will not be an immediate stimulus for our economy unless we are going to devote our energies and resources to providing training as soon as possible for our people.</p>, <p>Sir, we know the history of the past. One of the major bottlenecks we experienced previously when we were on the road to growth was the bottleneck of labour. As soon as our economy started to grow, a greater demand for labour and particularly skilled labour arose. Because there were limitations to that sort of labour and the number of people available to go undergo that training, that became the primary obstacle and bottleneck that we experienced in the growth process. The result was that because of greater competition from the private sector people educated by State organizations like the Railways and the Post Office were absorbed by the private sector and this caused shortages in the service sectors’ Sir, you know what the result of that was in terms of labour shortages and the provision of services. That is why I ask the hon. the Minister that serious consideration be given to this matter. We have to make the necessary provision for this in future. The hon. the Minister must do this in co-operation with the hon. the Minister of Labour and Labour representative organizations like the trade unions.</p>, <p>In the fourth place I believe that the hon. the Minister of Finance and other hon. Ministers involved in this—and in this respect. I think particularly of the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs—will have to call for more stringent discipline in regard to the increase in tariffs by our State corporations. The latest report of the Board of Trade and Industry, which, <i>inter alia</i>, criticized the tariff increases levied by ESCOM, is one of those indications that something can be done in connection with these State Corporations to prevent the cost of living rising at an even greater rate because of cost increases.</p>, <p>I think this calls for thorough investigation, an investigation which will be worthwhile, because in the past we have learned the lesson that as soon as the prices of steel and power are increased, price increases occur not only throughout the economy but also in the other service organizations like the Railways, the Post Office and so on. For this reason it is important—and I cannot emphasize this sufficiently—that discipline should be exercised in the ranks of State Corporations.</p>, <p>My last task is to tell the hon. the Minister that I think it is necessary to encourage growth and confidence in the economy of South Africa, and that, of course, is no easy task. But I should not be true to myself if I did not say this to the hon. the Minister. In my view the hon. the Minister should approach the hon. the Prime Minister, be honest with him and tell him that he feels he should vacate his office. [Interjections.] Mr. President, in this House we can accept proposals, discuss proposals and reject proposals, but the little contact I do have with the business world has convinced me that the hon. the Minister’s image is not what it should be among the businessmen whom I know. [Interjections.] I feel that we shall never be able to develop our economy unless we make a change in this respect as well. And I say this with all the seriousness at my command; I am definitely not being frivolous in this respect.</p>, <p>The hon. Senator is quite out of touch with the business world.</p>, <p>Yes, Mr. President, perhaps I am out of touch; perhaps the sort of business people I talk to are not the sort of people the hon. Senator Wimpie Gouws comes into contact with because he probably comes into contact with these people more than I do. But I think that I do come into contact with a reasonable cross-section of businessmen, and I want to give the hon. the Minister the assurance that the business sector in South Africa has lost confidence in the person acting as Minister of Finance.</p>, <p>Then they are hypocrites, because they tell me just the opposite.</p>, <p>Well, of course, there is a difference of opinion in this matter.</p>, <p>Does the hon. Senator want the job?</p>, <p>The hon. Senator asks if I want the job. Mr. President, I must tell the hon. Senator who put that question to me that if one is not even expected to be able to add or subtract, I am also good enough for that job—that is, the work of the hon. the Minister of Finance which the hon. Senator has now called a “job”—because in this job one signs for R14,8 million and one pays out more than R7 million without even knowing about it. In this job one cancels one’s signature on photostatic copies of a top secret letter of which there were no copies. I cannot understand how anyone can be so naïve and then keep on thinking one is competent enough to hold this post. It is a responsible post, Sir, our future depends on it, and I strongly recommend my suggestion to the hon. the Minister.</p>, <p>Mr. President, but for the latter portion of his speech, the hon. Senator Swanepoel who has just resumed his seat, did not make a bad speech at all. I think his comments on the budget were reasonable. It is his job to criticize and we shall always accept and give the necessary attention to reasonable criticism. I repeat, therefore, that I think his comments on the budget have been reasonable. As far as that is concerned, I just want to make three points briefly. Perhaps I did not understand him correctly or perhaps I did not listen properly. I think he could have placed more emphasis on the necessity for increased labour productivity, especially in the position in which we find ourselves today where prices are being subjected to great pressure and where the inflation rate may possibly increase. I think all sectors of industry and commerce—and do not let us forget the agricultural sector—must once again try to bring costs down and to increase the productivity of its labour force. We can try to combat inflation in that way. That is the one point.</p>, <p>The second point deals with his remark that he thinks stimulation has come too late. Mr. President, it is never too late; in fact, I would not have been happy had the hon. the Minister stimulated the economy to a greater extent than he has in has in his budget. I want to remind you, Sir, that there was no growth in 1977. Last year it was something like 2,5%—according to the Reserve Bank, I think—and we are planning for a growth rate of 4% this year which is a great improvement compared with previous years. I would rather we had a growth rate of 4% this year and increase it slowly to 5,5% next year than suddenly have a very high growth rate which we will probably be unable to maintain.</p>, <p>Thirdly, I just want to say something in regard to his remarks about the prices of State corporations. Time does not permit me to go into that matter too deeply, Mr. President, but I just want to draw the attention of the hon. the Minister and his colleagues, the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs, to a report of the Economic Research Bureau of Stellenbosch dealing with the building industry. They refer in that report, <i>inter alia</i>, to the role of administered prices, cement and other items and in that connection they say that it is not so much a question of price control but control over profits. There are few competitors or producers in most of those sectors and they do not really complete as far as their prices are concerned. Whenever they realize that a certain position is developing due to a drop in demand or for whatever reason that will have an effect on their profits, they make representations to the hon. the Minister to increase their price so that they can safeguard their profits. I want to draw the attention of the hon. the Minister to this because if that is in fact what is happening in that particular sector, I think it is a very unhealthy state of affairs. Most of these items are raw materials, and the increase in the price is ascribed to production costs in the building industry. We ourselves know what an important role that industry plays in our national economy.</p>, <p>†Now, Mr. President, I want to come back to the point which the hon. Senator Swanepoel raised right at the beginning of this speech, viz. the walk-out by hon. Senators on this side of the House, and, in addition, to his concluding remarks when he referred in a rather unfriendly manner, I thought, to the hon. the Minister of Finance. Unfortunately I was not…</p>, <p>There is nothing unfriendly about him.</p>, <p>He was being nice— very nice!</p>, <p>I was not present on Thursday when this happened but I want to say here and now that I fully endorse the actions of my hon. colleagues on this side of the House. [Interjections.] The blame for this action, Mr. President, rests fairly and squarely on the shoulders of hon. Senators on that side of the House … [Interjections.] . . , who have over the past few months been abusing the rules and procedures of this House in trying to achieve one object and one object only, namely, to discredit the hon. the Minister of Finance.</p>, <p>Mr. President, on a point of order: Is the statement that members of the Opposition have been abusing the rules of the House not a reflection on yourself, Sir?</p>, <p>I did not interpret the word “abuse” in as serious a sense as that. Nevertheless I think the hon. Senator should withdraw that word.</p>, <p>Mr. President, I do so at your request, and I would like to say that they have been misusing the procedures and practices of this House in attempting to achieve one aim only, viz … .</p>, <p>Mr. President, on a point of order: I should like to have your ruling on what the difference is between “abusing” and “misusing”.</p>, <p>Once again I think it is a question of degree. I request the hon. Senator to withdraw the word “misusing” and to proceed to another point.</p>, <p>Mr. President, once again I do so at your request and I want to say that the actions of hon. Senators on that side of the House in the course of the past few months have indeed been, as you have rightly said, Sir, a great disappointment to us. Those actions have had one object, and one object only, as I have said, viz. to discredit the hon. the Minister of Finance who has been a thorn in their flesh since the day he joined the NP ….</p>, <p>Hear, hear!</p>, <p>… and in particular since he became Minister of Finance and has occupied this very senior position in the Cabinet of this Government. The hon. Senators from Natal in particular have never forgiven him for this and they have since then been engaged in an endless vendetta against the hon. the Minister.</p>, <p>He was imported into Natal; he was never from Natal.</p>, <p>He was a Rhodesian.</p>, <p>The time has come for us to tell hon. Senators on that side that we have had enough of this behaviour.</p>, <p>Oh!</p>, <p>So far and no further!</p>, <p>Oh! I am shaking in my shoes.</p>, <p>Their conduct in this House has made a travesty and a mockery of parliamentary procedure, and this has to be stopped.</p>, <p>So “kragdadig” are they!</p>, <p>On a point of order, Sir: May the hon. Senator use the word “mockery” in that sense?</p>, <p>The hon. Senator must withdraw that expression.</p>, <p>I do so, Mr. President. Let us look at what has been happening here this session. First of all, during the first week commencing 20 February, the hon. the Leader of the Opposition moved a motion of censure which was debated at length, and the hon. Senators Crook and Webber—I shall refer to them several times—participated in this debate. Of course, the Information affair was their main topic. Secondly, during the sitting week that began on 6 March the hon. Senator Webber moved a motion asking for the appointment of a Select Committee, which again dealt with the Information Affair. This was hotly debated and again the hon. Senator Crook and the hon. Senator Webber were very much to the fore. During the sitting week that began on 13 March the Second Reading of the Part Appropriation Bill was taken, and apart from the hon. Senator Swanepoel—I must give him credit for that—the state of our economy and of our finances was of no concern to those hon. Senators. Again it was Information from beginning to end. Fourthly, only a week later, the Third Reading of the Part Appropriation Bill was taken and it was the same story over again, with the hon. Senator Webber and the hon. Senator Crook again debating the Information Affair. And, lastly, during the sitting week that began on 27 March we had the hon. Senator Crook back again at his worst asking for a Select Committee to investigate certain allegations …</p>, <p>Worst? I was doing my best!</p>, <p>Again it had to do with the one subject and one subject only—Information!</p>, <p>If that wasn’t good enough for you, I shall try again.</p>, <p>The question now arises. How much longer can we go on in this fashion? Does the public at large know that certain Senators on the other side of the House have been wasting the time of this House by repeatedly raising the Information affair, covering the same ground over and over again and attacking the hon. the Minister of Finance to the exclusion of all other important issues and matters which could be very fruitfully debated in this House. They did all this, Sir, despite the findings of the Erasmus Commission which had already in its first report completely exonerated the hon. the Minister of Finance of all blame concerning irregularities in the Department of Information.</p>, <p>On 6 March the Senate passed a motion expressing its disapproval of the unfounded allegations made against the credibility and integrity of the hon. the Minister and urgently appealing to Senators Webber and Crook to submit whatever information they might have about these irregularities to the Erasmus Commission. Mr. President, have they done so? Have they been to the commission? Of course, Sir, the answer is “no”. [Interjections.]</p>, <p>Order! I appeal to hon. Senators not to interrupt so that we may follow the speaker better.</p>, <p>Thank you, Mr. President. I repeat, the answer is “no”. Despite the fact that the Erasmus Commission has been sitting just across the street they would not even cross the street in order to make an appointment. Why have they not gone there, Sir? For the simple reason that they have no facts to lay before the commission. The hon. Senator Crook himself has admitted in this House that he possessed no material evidence. “I haven’t any facts”, he said here, “Mine is all hearsay.” All “hearsay”, that is all, Sir.</p>, <p>The hon. the Minister said he would ask the commission to subpoena the hon. Senator Crook.</p>, <p>Mr. President, that is the pathetic state of affairs in which these hon. Senators find themselves. They know they will make fools of themselves if they go before the Erasmus Commission.</p>, <p>They have already.</p>, <p>They will be laughed out of court.</p>, <p>Following the walk-out by hon. Senators on this side of the House last Thursday, <i>The Cape Times</i>, quoting the hon. Senator Crook again, said: “What he really intended was to reveal information which would have forced the resignation of Senator Horwood,” and the hon. Senator Webber sitting there with an eternal grin on his face, not to be outdone, added that he and Senator Crook had sufficient evidence to question certain findings of the Erasmus Commission. Mr. President, I do not believe a word of what they said to <i>The Cape Times</i>, not a single word. It is all balderdash, a figment of their imagination. That is what it is. I challenge them, even now at this late hour … [Interjection.] You are a big enough fool; don’t make it worse, please.</p>, <p>On a point of order, Sir, is the hon. Senator Dempsey allowed to call somebody a big fool?</p>, <p>Order! The hon. Senator Dempsey must withdraw that remark.</p>, <p>Mr. President, I withdraw it but I think I would rather describe him …</p>, <p>Order! The hon. Senator must withdraw unconditionally.</p>, <p>I withdraw it. Mr. President, I repeat that I challenge them, even at this late hour, to go to the Erasmus Commission and to lay before it whatever information they have. Of course, they haven’t anything whatsoever. What they have been trying all these months, Sir, is to implicate the hon. the Minister in the Information affair, not by means of facts but by innuendos, by sly references, by hearsay remarks, by rumour-mongering of the worst kind.</p>, <p>Sir, let me say immediately that we on this side of the House have complete confidence in the integrity and credibility of the hon. the Minister of Finance.</p>, <p>Hear, hear!</p>, <p>Nothing whatsoever that Opposition members may say will change our attitude in this regard. Furthermore we know that the public at large, I repeat, the public at large, and people in business and finance—I know what I am talking about in spite of what hon. Senator Swanepoel has said—hold the hon. the Minister in the highest regard as one of the ablest Ministers of Finance we have ever had.</p>, <p>Aren’t you blushing?</p>, <p>The very sound position in which our national economy finds itself is to a very large extent due to his careful planning over the past few years. He is undoubtedly the architect of the upturn in the economic conditions which is now under way. I wish to reiterate that we have the utmost faith and confidence in the hon. the Minister.</p>, <p>This brings me to another matter which concerns the Leader of the Opposition in the Other Place. I wish to refer to certain events surrounding him of which we all are already aware. According to newspaper reports the Leader of the Opposition in the Other Place stands accused of conniving with people hostile to South Africa and of divulging information of a sensitive nature, information which had been given to him in the strictest confidence.</p>, <p>That is a lie.</p>, <p>The Leader of the Opposition has as much as admitted publicly that he conveyed this sensitive information …</p>, <p>On a point of order, Sir, is the hon. Senator permitted to say “That is a lie”?</p>, <p>Order! Who said that?</p>, <p>Senator Winchester.</p>, <p>Order! Did the hon. Senator Winchester use those words?</p>, <p>Yes, Mr. President. I said that what the hon. Senator Dempsey had just said—that the hon. the Leader of the Opposition in the Other Place had connived with the enemies of South Africa—was a lie, and I repeat that it is a lie.</p>, <p>Order! The hon. Senator must withdraw that accusation.</p>, <p>I am unable to withdraw that, Mr. President.</p>, <p>Mr. President, the reason why I raise this matter here …</p>, <p>Order! The hon. Senator Winchester must withdraw that remark.</p>, <p>Mr. President, I am unable to withdraw something which I think is a lie.</p>, <p>Order! If the hon. Senator is not prepared to withdraw those words, I must order him to leave the Senate Chamber.</p>, <p>Whereupon the hon. Senator L. E. D. Winchester withdrew from the House for the remainder of the day’s sitting.</p>, <p>Mr. President, the reason why I raise this matter here, is because subsequently a hue and cry went up, especially from the English-language press, which is obviously hand in glove with that party, accusing the Government of playing smear politics. Imagine, that, Sir—playing smear politics! I ask the hon. Senators sitting there: What exactly have they been doing these last few months? What have they and their newspapers been doing? They have been waging a smear campaign against senior Government members, among them the hon. the Minister of Finance, and alleging things which cannot be substantiated by even one shred of evidence. And now they are squealing because they are being given a little of their own medicine. That is the whole position.</p>, <p>Mr. President, I just want to raise two further matters briefly. A certain amount of meanness and mischief has crept into, not only the reporting of politics I would say, but even into the reporting of economic events. In saying this I want to draw your attention to the following: About three months before you delivered your budget speech, the financial editor of the local evening newspaper wrote an article which appeared on Saturday, 9 December, under the heading: “There is no cash in the kitty for tax cuts.” He went on to indicate that the Government could be facing its most serious economic situation since the National Party came into power in 1948. This was three months before you delivered your budget speech. I have here an extract from <i>The Cape Times</i> dated the day after your speech was delivered. What does the heading say? It reads—</p>, <p>On a point of order, is the hon. Senator entitled to use a direct form of address as he has repeatedly done in his speech? He is using “you” and “your” instead of “the hon. the Minister”.</p>, <p>The hon. Senator must refer to another hon. Senator as “the hon. Senator”.</p>, <p>These are the very words—</p>, <p>And this newspaper which we accept ought to be well informed, had that to say only three months before! I should like to draw the attention of the hon. the Minister to this. Is it a question of lack of knowledge? Is it question of bias? What possesses a man who holds a responsible position like financial editor of a newspaper, to write an article of this nature which is completely out of touch with the real facts of the position? [Interjections.]</p>, <p>Secondly, I should like to refer to an article in <i>The Business Times</i> of April, written by a man by the name of Nigel Bruce. It concerns a report of the Board of Trade—in which very nasty things were said about the National Party, the Broederbond and all sorts of other organizations being involved in a kind of take-over of Escom, everything based not on facts but simply on what I might again call hearsay information.</p>, <p>*Mr. President, I repeat it is really a sad day for us when we sink to this low level. Today it is a question of a total war being waged against the National Party and against the Government in all possible spheres, not only in the political sphere here in Parliament and outside but even in the economic field, i.e. the way in which we are being sabotaged. What must prospective investors in this country think when they read that our economy is in such a state that it will not be possible for the hon. the Minister to reduce taxation in any single respect? That is totally wrong, totally unenlightened and is a deliberate misrepresentation. There is also an article which deals with Escom which has suddenly become the football of the Broederbond and of the NP. I have nothing more to say in that regard. The chairman of the Board of Trade and Industry viewed this matter in a serious light and he referred those two articles by a certain Nigel Bruce to the Press Council. I think we all look forward with interest to what the Press Council will decide in this connection.</p>, <p>I want to conclude by once again on behalf of this side of the House expressing our appreciation to the hon. the Minister of Finance for the way in which he is handling the financial affairs of this country. Mr. President, he did not inherit a good estate. We know what the position was. [Interjections.] As far as our foreign exchange position and the position of the other sectors of our economy were concerned, things were not healthy at all. The hon. the Minister developed a fixed pattern according to which he would control those finances. Initially he was severely criticized even by the hon. Senator Swanepoel, the main speaker opposite, who thought that the hon. the Minister should have stimulated the economy sooner. He had very good reasons for not doing so. Our balance of payments position is very healthy at the moment and he has made concessions in other respects. From time to time he still does so by way of various announcements which we hope will have an even greater stimulatory effect on our economy than at present.</p>, <p>I have said before, and I repeat, that we on this side of the House believe that the hon. Senator Horwood is one of the most capable Ministers of Finance we have had for a long time. I want to ask the hon. the Minister not to pay any attention to what that side of the House says, and neither should he worry or be distressed about what they say. We will not allow him to resign from his post. He is far too valuable to this country and to this Government. We hope that he will continue to serve the country in that important capacity for many years to come.</p>, <p>Mr. President, the hon. Senator Dempsey spoke at great length and delivered so little. I do not propose to deal with the defence of my hon. colleagues. They are quite able to defend themselves. He endorsed the statement made by my colleague, the hon. Senator Swanepoel which was that there was a need for greater labour productivity. I think everybody in this House will agree with that statement. He queried the statement made by the hon. Senator Swanepoel that stimulation had come too late. I should like to ask him whether he is opposed to greater stimulation. Because if he is, then I am afraid that he, as an economist, is seeing the signs the wrong way around. He indicated that the administered prices were not a control of prices but of profits. As far as I am concerned the administered prices have crippled the agricultural community. I shall come to that later during the course of my address.</p>, <p>When he says that we on the Opposition side have been talking about matters of no consequence, I want to ask him whether he does not consider the misappropriation of millions of rand of public money as a matter of great consequence. If he does not, I certainly do!</p>, <p>My colleague, the hon. Senator Swanepoel, dealt with the economic situation at some great length and therefore I shall only deal briefly with this particular subject. During the course of the part appropriation debate I said that confidence was returning in the short-term but that entrepreneurs were awaiting developments in the labour field before deciding on their course in the long-term. Since then the first interim report of the Wiehahn Commission has been tabled and so has the Government’s White Paper. The commission’s report has been very widely and loudly acclaimed whilst the White Paper has indicated that the Government accepts most of their recommendations. I trust, however, that the hon. the Minister of Labour and his colleagues will not be stampeded by the activities of the extreme right wing into slowing down the pace of development. The problem in South Africa during the recent past has been a crisis of confidence. The implementation of the recommendations contained in the interim report of the Commission of Inquiry into the Monetary System and Monetary Policy in South Africa, and of those contained in the Wiehahn Commission’s report will do much to dispel the doubts and bring about a state that will generate economic development and employment opportunities, which in themselves, will make for a better standard of living for all sections of our community. The eyes of commerce and industry are therefore on the Government to see whether they will remove the shackles that have held back progress for such a long time, and whether this will be done quickly enough to attain a growth rate of 4% per annum. I believe that is the aim of the Government for this particular year. However, whilst that growth rate of 4%, in view of the inflation rate of between 10% and 12% per annum, will reflect a worthwhile turnaround, we must place on record that we need a growth rate of something like 6% per annum to provide job opportunities for all those who come on the labour market each year. That is apart from the backlog of unemployed labour that we have as a result of the very low growth rate over the past two years.</p>, <p>Senator Dempsey is happy.</p>, <p>Well, they are always happy because they do not know what they are talking about.</p>, <p>I think we must have a far more dynamic policy—a go for growth policy, far more than is contained in the budget before us. I fear that the additional stimulative measures that have been announced will not provide sufficient stimulus to promote consumer recovery. In this respect I wish to refer to the State corporations. In his budget speech, the hon. the Minister stated that the recommendation of the Interdepartmental Committee for the Determination of Capital Investment Priorities that every endeavour should be made to reach a stage by the middle ’eighties where the share of the public sector in total investment should be limited to approximately 40%, has been accepted. We find this heartening. However, the time has arrived for the Government to take a good look into the expansion of the State corporations. I think it will be found that some of these subsidiaries should be sold to the private sector. The State corporations were founded for a specific purpose. It is my submission that it is not their function to proceed with empire building. I am afraid this is exactly what has happened in the past. Let these State corporations concentrate on the functions for which they were founded and leave the other activities to the private sector. In this way not only will the public sector’s investment be reduced but better overall efficiency will be obtained.</p>, <p>Sir, I now wish to deal with the problems facing the agricultural sector. The hon. the Minister of Finance has referred to the economic plight of the farmer which has been aggravated by the serious drought that has persisted over a large part of South Africa. We on this side have so often pointed out the difficulties under which farmers have to labour. Costs of production have escalated alarmingly over the past few years but the return to the farmer has certainly not kept pace by any stretch of the imagination. I have found that many people are criticizing the recent increase in the price of maize and maize products. I want to hasten to record that I am not criticizing the increase at all. To my mind the farmer ie fully entitled to the increase that has been granted to him. That increase may enable him, as a struggling farmer, to carry on instead of being a candidate for the insolvency court the circumstances in which the agricultural sector has found itself over the past few years, farmers have certainly been on the way to the insolvency court.</p>, <p>Nonetheless, Sir, the higher maize prices will effect the cost of production because maize products are used very widely as food for human and animal consumption.</p>, <p>Some of the budget proposals will help to lessen the burden on the farming community. These are very welcome indeed. However, I should like to stress—I cannot do so too strongly, Sir—that the so-called subsidies to the farming community are not in fact subsidies to that community at all. They are in fact subsidies to the consumer. I should like to underline that and to underscore it as heavily as possible. The farmer does not seek subsidies. What he wants is a fair price to cover his production costs as well as a reasonable return for his labour and capital. In the past Government policy has kept down the price of agricultural produce and has placated the farmer by paying some sort of subsidy. I trust that those days are over and that the Government has taken a decision to ensure that the farmer will be paid a reasonable price for his product to enable him to cover his production costs and receive a reasonable return. If it is necessary to subsidize, subsidies can be paid on the product in order to bring down the price for the consumer.</p>, <p>With the greatest respect, I should like to submit that the farmer is the backbone of this country. We have ridden on his back for too long. It is time that the agricultural sector received a decent break. If production is to be maintained—let alone increased—and production improved to meet the increasing population of this country, either the consumer will have to pay a higher price for the product or the Treasury will have to apply higher subsidies in order to keep down the prices of essential foodstuffs.</p>, <p>The relief that has been announced by the hon. the Minister applies in particular to the wheat and maize farmers. I should, however, like to bring to the attention of the hon. the Minister the fact that many sections of the sugar belt have gone through one of the worst droughts in history. The crushing season at some of these mills will be severely curtailed with the result that the sugar farmers are going to find themselves in financial difficulties. The fulltime farmer has of course recourse to the Land and Agricultural Bank but the farmer who has other interests—be they commercial, industrial or professional—does not have that right I am not asking for subsidies for those farmers, Sir. I am only asking that the hon. the Minister make arrangements with commercial banks so that they will be sympathetic towards the problems of these farmers to enable them to keep on running their business.</p>, <p>An appeal was made in the Other Place to the hon. the Minister to re-examine the taxes and other levies that are imposed on the inputs of a farming community with a view to eliminating them so as to reduce the cost of the final product. I think this is a most deserving request We, the official Opposition, will certainly support it without hesitation.</p>, <p>Sir, I come now to something about which I am rather concerned, i.e. the invasion of the powers of the Natal Provincial Council. Last year the Natal Provincial Council passed legislation to amend the Local Government Ordinance. As required by law, this was referred to the State President for his assent. To our amazement, we found that it was subsequently promulgated with certain omissions. Certain provisions had been deleted. According to my construction, this is in direct conflict with the provisions of section 89 of the Republic of South Africa Constitution Act, No. 32 of 1961. This section provides that—</p>, <p>Nowhere can I find any reference to the effect that the State President can delete portions of an ordinance passed by a provincial council. The State President is, of course, advised by the responsible Minister who is the Minister of the Interior and Immigration in this particular instance. I wonder whether this is another case of a Minister signing a document without reading it; if not, how is this invasion of the rights of a provincial council explained away? To my mind the alteration of an ordinance is as illegal as the channelling of secret funds from the Defence Special Account to the Department of Information.</p>, <p>I want now to deal very briefly with the question of fuel. I am pleased to see that a considerable amount has been provided in the estimates for fuel research. However, I am sure that much more will have to be provided in the future. We fully support the decision to channel money to Sasol II, and we also fully support the extension of that project which, when it is completed, will provide approximately 50% of the fuel needs of this country. Those of us who were privileged to visit Sasol a few months ago were very impressed with the work that is being done and we realized the enormity of this project. But, Sir, the demand for energy is likely to increase, not to decrease, and energy is necessary for the development of our country. I feel therefore that alternative sources of energy must be sought and that fuel saving measures must be encouraged in every sector. To that end I recommend that low cost loans be provided to farmers and others to change over from diesel engines or diesel boilers to electric pumping or solar heating.</p>, <p>A start is to be made this year on the canals from the Pongolapoort dam and we were advised by the hon. the Minister that the crops of sugar cane, cotton and citrus were to be planted on the Makatini Flats. I have suggested to the hon. the Minister of Agriculture that the crop of cassava be considered because this crop will grow in poorer soil, it is resilient to drought and, furthermore, it can be used for the production of fuel. I want to refer the hon. the Minister and his colleagues to the <i>Sugar Journal</i> of February 1979 where we read the following—</p>, <p>Cassava can be used for the production of starch as well as ethanol, and extensive experiments have been proposed in Australia. Brazil has already embarked on a scheme for producing ethanol from cassava, and it is planned that ethylalcohol will be manufactured to replace petrol completely and extend diesel supplies by 50%. I commend this to the Cabinet for further consideration.</p>, <p>This article reveals that a plant for the processing of ethanol from cassava can be erected for R14 million, which is, as you will know, Sir, the cost of <i>To the Point</i> to date. It is not a great sum of money. [Interjections.]</p>, <p>That is beside the point.</p>, <p>Mr. President, I now wish to deal with a few matters relating to the Budget in the short time still available to me. Naturally, we will deal more fully with them when the various measures come before us. Right at the outset I want to say that we fully support the improved conditions of service for public servants. But I would like to say, as far as I am concerned, that I would like the Police to receive special consideration because the Police are our first line of defence. They are subjected to danger, hardship and derision daily. Many of them serve in out-of-the-way areas at great inconvenience and sacrifice to themselves. My submission is that they are entitled to special treatment, and I make no apology for asking for further relief for them.</p>, <p>The next item I wish to deal with is the question of pensioners. Whilst I welcome the relief given to pensioners, I reiterate once again my view that these senior citizens should be treated far more generously. It is no use the hon. the Minister coming back to me, as I am sure he is going to, and telling me the same as he told me last year, namely, that pensions have risen far more quickly than the consumer price index has. I say this because, Sir, the consumer price index is not indicative of the spending patterns of the pensioners who by the very nature of their restricted budgets are not able to do their shopping at the most beneficial and favourable sources. I again issue a request, perhaps a challenge, Sir, to the hon. the Minister and also to the hon. the Minister of Social Welfare and Pensions, that they appoint a commission to inquire into the needs and the spending patterns of pensioners because to my knowledge no such commission had been appointed in the past. I feel therefore that it is high time that this oversight was remedied.</p>, <p>The consolidation of the Black states is another matter, and here the hon. the Minister proposes that an amount of R69 million be made available for this purpose. In view of the appointment of the commission to further investigate and review the 1975 consolidation proposals, I wonder whether there is an earnest desire to spend this amount of money. I still await an answer to my query as to why more than R15 million voted in each of the past two financial years, 1977-’78 and 1976-’77, were unspent. This was about a third of the amount voted in each case. There were no constraints at that time as far as boundaries were concerned. What were the constraints? Why was this money not spent? This, to me, is very odd indeed, and I think that the whole handling of the programme was most inept.</p>, <p>I have dealt with the policy of the past, Sir, and I make no apology for having dealt with it, but I have also dealt with what is to be the policy in the future because that is the great problem—the sword that is hanging over both the Black and White people of South Africa. The uncertainty is there and the uncertainty will remain until we are told what will happen in the future. How long must we wait? We are told that it could be anything from two to five years. Two to five years is a very long time in anybody’s lifetime.</p>, <p>Many recommendations have been made and also reported in the publication <i>To The Point</i> in regard to the consolidation of kwaZulu. Some have recommended that the whole area north of the Tugela should go to kwaZulu. Others have said that the whole of Natal apart from the Durban-Newcastle corridor should go to kwaZulu. What is the attitude of this Government in regard to this? There has been no guideline whatsoever; all we are told is that there is a commission of inquiry investigating.</p>, <p>What about Sea Point?</p>, <p>Yes, it could be Sea Point too. They should take that hon. Senator and put him in that sea! How long must we wait, Sir? Why have the small towns that have been declared released areas not been bought out? Lack of money cannot be the excuse. That excuse has been completely blown.</p>, <p>While I am dealing with that, perhaps I should deal with the question of estate duty. I have raised this matter with the hon. the Minister before. What is the position of estate duty in respect of people who die and whose properties have been proclaimed as being required for the purposes of consolidation? I want to give an example just to illustrate the point. Take the township of Nongoma that has been declared a released area. This means that no White may purchase land there except under a permit from the Minister. In the case of a death, there is no willing buyer, willing seller. How does an appraiser determine the value of that property? There is only one valid buyer and that is a government agency or perhaps a Black. So far I think only one property in that whole area has been bought out, and then they told us that it was a mistake, that it should never have been bought out. And this is not the only town in South Africa that is affected; there are dozens of them throughout the country. I feel therefore that some guideline has to be given. We have to know what the position is in respect of these towns that have been declared released areas.</p>, <p>Mr. President, the reduction in direct taxation on income is certainly a step in the right direction, and the intention of reducing direct taxes and increasing indirect taxes is also something with which we agree. There has been criticism that the proposals of the hon. the Minister favour mostly those at the top end. I think it is apt to record that the previous maximum figure of R28 000 above which the maximum rates applied, was fixed many years ago. The upper limit is now being increased to R30 000, a mere R2 000 more. But if the inflation rate during the intervening years is taken into consideration one will find that that R28 000 should be something like R58 000, a considerable difference from the R30 000 now proposed. I think it is necessary to place on record here that statistics reveal that if we accept the rand as having been worth 100 cents in the base year 1970, the purchasing power in 1978 was only 45 cents. I think it is apt to record further that the large income earners are generally those executives who carry heavy responsibilities and the entrepreneurs who create job opportunities for many others. The aim most certainly must be to reduce even further the high marginal rates whilst at the same time not unduly burdening the lower income groups.</p>, <p>The hon. the Minister referred to the question of the taxation of fringe benefits and I want to say, Sir, that the reason for these fringe benefits having been introduced was in my opinion the heavy marginal rate of tax at the top end of the scale. I think that in many cases it is most unfortunate that fringe benefits were resorted to because, if one works it out, eventually the so-called beneficiary suffers because the fringe benefits do not form part of the pensionable benefits which will accrue to that person.</p>, <p>Nonetheless, Sir, I must record further that even the State has resorted to fringe benefits in the non-taxation of the housing subsidies of public servants. Suffice it to say that whatever method is adopted in quantifying fringe benefits some anomalies will arise and, apart from sounding a word of caution as to its application, I shall reserve further comment until the draft Bill or the proposals are available. I do trust, however, that we in this House will have an opportunity of debating the matter before the proposals are implemented.</p>, <p>The hon. the Minister also mentioned the possibility of a capital gains tax and said that a draft Bill would be published later in the year. I want to record once again my opinion that South Africa is a developing and not a developed country and that private capital formation must be encouraged at all costs. It must certainly not be hampered. However, I think that further comment would not be apt at this stage save to say that whereas the hon. the Minister has said that that impost will be a very limited and modest amount, it does not often stay that way once a tax has been introduced. It often becomes very widespread and very heavy, and this danger we must oppose and prevent.</p>, <p>I shall deal very briefly with estate duty, having already dealt partly with this matter. We are very conscious of the increased rebates which the hon. the Minister has allowed but these are not commensurate with the benefits which have accrued to the Treasury through the ravages of inflation. I hope, Sir, that as time goes by, the hon. the Minister will be able to increase these rebates even further.</p>, <p>I have dealt previously with the question of life assurance on the life of a deceased person. I want to say once again that the average man in farming or industry has not got the ready cash available to invest R35 000 or R40 000 in Government securities. Therefore, the provision that up to R80 000 is allowed, favours only those who have liquid assets in their estates. I think that this requires further examination because whereas the average person might be able to afford cover on his life for R80 000, particularly if he resorts to what we call term insurance, most of us will certainly not have R40 000 in ready cash to invest in Government securities.</p>, <p>The hon. the Minister was informed in the Other Place about the difficulties which have arisen in the case of widows who as beneficiaries receive retirement annuities which carry death cover. The present value is taken as a basis for estate duty purposes but there is no ready cash and this has led to the widow being very severely embarrassed in some cases because the cash has had to be applied to the payment of estate duty instead of her maintenance. I know that the fiscus has to take its share but I would like to ask that another look be taken at this aspect to see if relief cannot be applied in deserving cases.</p>, <p>Another anomaly as I see it is in the case of divorced persons. I fully appreciate the concession made by the hon. the Minister that a divorced person who is maintaining children will now be taxed as a married person. But I think it is most unfair, Sir, and most unreasonable, that a divorced man who is paying a substantial maintenance payment to his ex-wife should be taxed as an unmarried man. I think this is most unjust because his expenses are as high as those of a married man who is maintaining his wife. I would appeal to the hon. the Minister and his department to adopt a far more sympathetic view in these cases because the loss to the Treasury will be minimal.</p>, <p>Time does not permit me to go into greater detail but when the various tax measures come forward we will deal with them at far greater length. I would like to say, Sir, that the budget has some measures which are most welcome and others which we feel do not go far enough. As far as the stimulation of the economy is concerned, it is my submission that we have not gone far enough, and I would like to recommend to the hon. the Minister that the import surcharge be removed as soon as is humanly possible. This will bring down costs and contribute further to consumer-led recovery and to a better economic outlook for the future of this country.</p>, <p>Mr. President, the hon. Senator Bozas will forgive me if I do not follow him. I want to tell the hon. Senator Swanepoel—I am sorry he is not here at the moment—that he gave the hon. Minister some advice today.</p>, <p>Good advice.</p>, <p>A little later I shall also give him and his party some advice, good advice. I think the hon. Senator Swanepoel has shown bad taste.</p>, <p>Hear, hear!</p>, <p>The Chief Whip on this side put a very reasonable question to him, and he then accused him of making so few speeches.</p>, <p>What was the question?</p>, <p>No, it was a very reasonable question; I do not know what happened behind the scenes. He said he came to him in his office and asked him a question. Were you there too?</p>, <p>It could not have been a reasonable question …</p>, <p>A silly dom question.</p>, <p>Sir, I say it was a reasonable question which was answered in a distasteful fashion. We on this side …</p>, <p>Mr. President, on a point of order. Is the hon. Senator Webber entitled to say I asked a silly question? I was very reasonable and I think Senator Swanepoel who is not here will admit that; I was very fair. I asked him if I had not shown him the Minister of Finance’s programme. If he thinks that is silly, Sir, then I think he is being stupid.</p>, <p>Order! I must ask the hon. Chief Whip to withdraw the word “stupid”.</p>, <p>I withdraw it, Sir.</p>, <p>Mr. President, on this side our numbers are about four times those of hon. Senators on the other side, and if they think we should talk more, then we shall have to consider allocating time according to the strength of the parties.</p>, <p>Hear, hear!</p>, <p>That would be fair and we would then be able to give them more of a hearing.</p>, <p>It is clear to me that the Opposition is no longer seeking information. They are carrying on a vendetta. This vendetta has been in progress for a long time; it has been in progress for years. And do you know, Sir, against whom it is being waged? It is being waged against English-speakers who side with the NP. In 1949, just after the NP had come into power in 1948, the first English-speaker to side with the NP was Mr. George Wynne. They carried on a vendetta against him. They did it in the case of Mr. Trollip and also in the case of Mr. Frankie Waring. Now they are so upset with us because we walked out, but what did they do just over a year ago to an English-speaker in this House? When the hon. Senator Poorter rose to speak, they walked out. [Interjections.] On more than one occasion they have done it to the hon. the Minister of Finance. As I say, Sir, they are no longer seeking information; they are carrying on a vendetta. They have moved right away from the guilty parties, because that no longer suits them, they are out of the picture. Now they are aiming at the English-speakers; they want to get at them. Over the years the UP always acted like a sacred cow to the English-speakers. The UP imagined they were their mother! The NRP say they are the children of the UP, but if that is so they are a lot of weak children. They have rejected the name of their parents. They sit here under another name. They are either adopted children or they are the illegitimate children of the UP!</p>, <p>Victor Hugo, the French writer and author, said on one occasion that if he had to choose between women and wine, he chose wine time and again. If I have to choose between the accusations and the word of the hon. Senator Crook and of other hon. Senators in the Opposition, and the word of the hon. the Minister of Finance, then I do not even have a choice—I choose the Minister.</p>, <p>Then you must accept Connie Mulder’s word too.</p>, <p>Let us look at the facts. The hon. the Minister was appointed to the Cabinet as a newcomer and an English-speaker. Those are the very things they will not forgive him for. I can tell the hon. the Minister they will never forgive him for that as long as he lives. They have not forgiven the other English-speakers either and they never will. I want to make this statement: The fact is that the evildoers in the Information affair misled the Afrikaans-speakers. Then of course it is obvious that they thought as a newcomer and English-speaker he would be an easy victim to mislead. That is why hon. Senators object to him; that is why they wage a campaign of hate against him. I believe the hon. the Minister of Finance. I want to tell the hon. the Minister that I believe him. I am sorry this has happened to him; I am sorry for what he has gone through; I am sorry that this has had to happen to him. The Opposition has shifted the accent from the guilty to the innocent. There sit the new patriots, and what are they doing? Every day they are trying to outdo the Progs.</p>, <p>Mr. President, do you know how the political situation in South Africa has changed? When my benchmate and I entered politics, the struggle was to oust the Government. In those days the Opposition tried to oust the Government, but what is happening today? Every day the Opposition parties are trying to be the official Opposition, in other words, to oust and remove the party which is the official Opposition. I get my information from Swellendam. There it is not really a fight against the Government by way of scandal about the Information affair. They are libelling and defaming one another. [Interjections.]</p>, <p>They say the UP supporters are now voting for the Hertzogites.</p>, <p>Because they have no responsibility, they are carrying on this vendetta to the detriment of South Africa. They do not realize it, Sir. The hon. the Minister of Finance is the man who is known throughout the world today. In the international and financial world he is the man who is known as the man of South Africa. Touch him, and you touch South Africa. The whole world knows there is no alternative to the NP.</p>, <p>The hon. Senator Henderson was very cross with me when I interjected that if you touched the NP you touched South Africa. I now want to call on another authority to confirm my statement. After the dissolution of the UP there was an interview with their former leader, Sir De Villiers Graaff, on the radio and on television. I followed that interview on television. He was asked nicely to say why his party had ceased to exist. He gave his reasons. Not all the reasons are at issue here, but the last reason he gave was this: He said that the National Party was no longer a political party but had become a national movement. Those were his words, Sir, and he used them in 1977 just before a general election. Then we had the general election in 1977 and that national movement became a flood. It swept away the United Party. It shattered it and all that remains is flotsam.</p>, <p>The UP did not contest the election in 1977.</p>, <p>I am not talking about that. I am now talking about Sir De Villiers Graaff. He spoke before the election. The UP did not contest it. But then that flood came and swept everything away. [Interjections.] As I say, only a few bits of flotsam remained. Sir, what is the tendency of a flood? The tendency of a flood is that it continues to rise higher and higher and each time it takes away the flotsam which remained before. This party will yet wash away all of you. [Interjections.] No, I do not want him, but he can go on sleeping peacefully, the brave hero. The UP was a strong party. Each time since 1948, in election after election, the flood came and each time the NP washed away more of the flotsam.</p>, <p>Flotsam like the hon. the Minister of Finance.</p>, <p>We shall overwhelm everybody yet. None of you will remain. [Interjections.] Sir, why do we no longer want to listen to the hon. Senator Crook? Why do we walk out? Why do we no longer want to listen to him?</p>, <p>The hon. Senator Webber is next.</p>, <p>This matter of the Information scandal has been thrashed out like no other matter in the history of South Africa. An investigation is being made to an extent never before undertaken. There is a judicial commission, there is a parliamentary commission and there is an inter-departmental committee. Sir, they have run away. Any opposition always asks for a judicial commission. [Interjections.] When the Government appointed a judicial commission, they ran away. Then they wanted a Select Committee. When a parliamentary Select Committee was appointed, both opposition parties refused to serve on it.</p>, <p>That is untrue.</p>, <p>They refused to serve on it. [Interjections.] Then your leaders lied because those are the statements I heard them make over the radio. [Interjections.] They were too frightened. They have nothing and they do not want to take anything to the Erasmus Commission. They have nothing. If they had got hold of anything, they would have gone, but they have nothing. They walk about like vultures around a rubbish dump looking for carrion. But they can find no carrion to take to the Erasmus Commission. What I find interesting is that they are no longer vultures, but a lot of fowls. A vulture picks up what is lying on the surface but a fowl scratches. This is the warning I want to give them today. They must be careful not to scratch too deeply. If they scratch too deeply, then they will dig up their own burnt tracks from before 1948.</p>, <p>The Opposition are doing something strange. They give to understand that this is the first time in the history of the world or of South Africa that something like this has happened. There is the human factor. That is unfortunately so. We are sorry about it, but there is the human factor. I do not want to go back into the past. I could go back to their régime. Those people are now dead. I do not want to mention their names, let them rest in peace. I only want to mention one thing, namely, the documents that were burned, the documents of the demobilization committee.</p>, <p>That was before the rinderpest.</p>, <p>As a result of that demobilization … [Interjections.] It seems to me the hon. Senator is a child of the rinderpest.</p>, <p>Order! Hon. Senators must moderate their language.</p>, <p>Mr. President, should the hon. member not be obliged to withdraw the words “he is a child of the rinderpest?”</p>, <p>I think that was more a figure of speech that the hon. Senator used.</p>, <p>Mr. President, I know many people who are children of the rinderpest. [Interjections.]</p>, <p>I want to tell those hon. friends that nothing is being covered up. Nothing will be covered up. We on this side want this thing to be exposed. We want the evil sore to be cut out, right down to the bone. We do not want to live any longer with an evil, festering sore. [Interjections.] Sir, we are filled with angry shame. You know, Sir, people filled with angry shame are dangerous. I am filled with angry shame. Such people are like a weak ox which pushes. We are filled with angry shame over this matter. We did not deserve this thing. We did not ask for it. We are full of angry shame over <i>The Citizen.</i> We built up this party on the money of the poor people of South Africa. We built it up step by step. We came with the floods and we gathered them in. The purchase of <i>The Citizen</i> was a crime against the National Party.</p>, <p>And <i>To the Point?</i></p>, <p>I want to tell hon. Senators something else. In this connection I can fortunately assure them that it gives me satisfaction too. That newspaper had no effect on the 1977 results.</p>, <p>Nonsense!</p>, <p>It is not read in the Cape Province, and the National Party won most constituencies from the Opposition in the Cape Province. [Interjections.]</p>, <p>There is something else, Sir. We want to help the Opposition. I want to tell them something today. We could have taken three of the four SAP seats in the Cape Province. We left them because we wanted to help this Opposition, the NRP.</p>, <p>You help the SAP to help the NRP!</p>, <p>Yes, they would have stood by you and not the Progs. We thought those three or four seats could have saved the Opposition. They are a bit better than the Progs. The Progs are completely anti-patriotic. They are only unpatriotic, this Opposition. The Opposition do their best to draw red herrings across our path. The hon. the Minister of Finance is used by them as a red-herring. They want to lead us away from the truth. I want to tell you why. You know, over the years they have been dying for the NP to make a single mistake against an English-speaker. They are hoping the NP will treat an English-speaker badly who has joined it. That is what they are waiting for; that is what they are looking for. Sir, I want to tell them today that they will have to wait a long time. We do not allow ourselves to be misled. The guilty in this matter will be punished.</p>, <p>Mr. President, we have become used to the speeches of the hon. Senator Van Staden and therefore they do not surprise us in the least. He however, referred to the heretic campaign … this is how I interpret his word “ketterjag”—or campaign of hate against the hon. the Minister of Finance. He also compared this campaign to that allegedly waged against former Ministers in this House, i.e. Ministers Trollip and Waring. Mr. President, there is, however, this difference. I do not recall either Minister Waring or Minister Trollip ever complaining about it or organizing a walk-out to avoid facing his accusers. They stood up to the attacks against them and the criticisms levelled against them until they resigned. They never complained at all. They faced their critics like men.</p>, <p>Who is complaining?</p>, <p>Mr. President, an hon. Senator asks “who is complaining”? All the speeches of today and almost every speech made from those benches last week, as well as the walk-out the other day, are all part of this unending complaint.</p>, <p>The hon. Senator Van Staden also referred to the result of the 1977 election. I would have thought that that was one of the last things the NP should refer to. If ever a party in South Africa or anywhere in the Western world has something over which to hang their heads in shame, it is in regard to the 1977 election held in South Africa. The Prime Minister of the day, who was held up to us as a national hero for whom we had to vote because he had safeguarded the future of our country, knew of—and on a great deal of evidence actually promoted—the financing to a major extent of a newspaper and of a journal that sought to support his own party.</p>, <p>With public funds!</p>, <p>This was done with public funds in the knowledge that it was a serious irregularity.</p>, <p>Which magazine?</p>, <p>And here we have that hon. Senator boasting about the outcome of that election! It was an election fought on entirely false and spurious grounds, and that hon. Senator is boasting about it so bravely! Mr. President, this does not surprise me. The morality of the NP in regard to that election does not surprise me in the least. After all, we have had an even more recent example of this. Dr. Mulder was proved to be a liar in regard to his statement in May 1978 in the Other Place.</p>, <p>Mr. President, may I ask a question?</p>, <p>I will answer no questions; please sit down.</p>, <p>Dr. Mulder, as Minister of Information, was proved to be a liar in the Other Place. He subsequently resigned as a member of the Cabinet He remained the leader of the NP in the Transvaal but subsequently resigned that post as well. He was then given an ultimatum. If he accepted the fact that he had been a liar for a second time, he would be accepted as a fully qualified member of the NP. That is the morality of the party about which the hon. Senator Van Staden is boasting today! Therefore, Sir, we can pay very little attention to the comments made by the hon. Senator Van Staden or to any of the comments made by Senators on that side who pretend to be so offended by an affront to their high moral standards. When a man can prove himself twice to be a liar, he is fully qualified to be a member of their party! There are also other examples arising from the whole of the Information scandal.</p>, <p>But, Mr. President, we have had to deal with a string of accusations about personal vendettas, <i>ad nauseam</i> attacks and complaints against the hon. the Minister of Finance, the Leader of this House, in regard to this Information affair. The hon. the Minister of Finance has also complained most bitterly. He has promised to subpoena members on this side of the House; he has promised to deal with us. He has promised to have us under oath before a judge. These are very serious threats, Mr. President. We await with interest the outcome of these threats and promises.</p>, <p>You avoid that like the plague! There is one thing to do and that is go across the road. [Interjections.]</p>, <p>Mr. President, these complaints have been personalized to the extent that this is now regarded by hon. Senators opposite as a personal vendetta by my colleague, the hon. Senator Crook, against the hon. the Minister of Finance. In their attempts to justify this attack we were faced with their unprecedented walk-out of this House the other day. This was a walk-out which affronted the dignity of this House. It affronted the standing of this House. These are matters to which hon. Senators on that side are constantly referring. They have made themselves guilty of preventing debate on an issue of major national importance.</p>, <p>What issue?</p>, <p>They have made themselves guilty of undermining the whole democratic process about which we are always hearing so much from hon. Senators opposite.</p>, <p>I should, however, like to deal first of all with this allegation against my colleague, i.e. that the hon. Senator Crook is leading this attack against the hon. the Minister of Finance on behalf of the Opposition in this House.</p>, <p>Are you aiding and abetting him?</p>, <p>Mr. President, the hon. Senator Crook has been our spokesman on this issue because he is legally trained, because he has had a long experience as a Senator and, in particular, because he has had long experience of exposing scandals in the public interest. That is why we have chosen him as our spokesman on this matter. He has qualities of personal integrity and determination which should be an example to many of those hon. Senators opposite. He has qualities of unflinching courage, whether as an artillery officer facing overwhelming odds, as a prisoner-of-war facing hardships, as an escapee and a partisan or as a politician who over the years has had to face Nationalist Party majorities, inside and outside the House, where he has had to endure taunts, insults and contumely from opponents in many cases with a guilty conscience. He has had the satisfaction of successfully exposing at least one of these scandals on our public life. As far as we on this side of the House are concerned, he enjoys our full support for his courage and dedication to duty in respect of this House and as a public representative in South Africa. He is a man who has been elected by the electorate of South Africa to protect their interests.</p>, <p>You are outstaying your welcome.</p>, <p>I think the hon. Senator Crook’s example could well be followed by the hon. the Minister of Finance whose duty it is to protect the interests and the finances of the taxpayers of South Africa. He is an hon. Minister who has illegally signed away millions of rands of taxpayers’ money. He has gone to extraordinary lengths to ensure that he would not see incriminating evidence just a few millimetres from his signature. My heart bleeds for the hon. gentleman; it really does, Mr. President, when he finds life at the top a little too tough for his kind and gentle heart to endure; a little too tough for his tolerant nature! Really, my heart bleeds for him that he should be subjected to so many unjust attacks, to so many personal vendettas at the hands of that hard, harsh, unkind, unfeeling, and apparently fearsome friend, the hon. Senator Crook! If the hon. the Minister will accept it, I will send him a box of tissues with which he can wipe away the copious tears that he has so fulsomely shed since the days when the brutal students from Natal University bullied him so severely, when he had hoped …</p>, <p>When one is sarcastic one must be clever. The hon. Senator is much too clumsy.</p>, <p>Mr. President, when one tries to escape from the responsibility for one’s own actions, one must certainly be far more clever than the hon. the Minister of Finance has been so far. The hon. the Minister had expected peace and servile respect in the academic cloisters but instead he had to face up to the brutal students who bullied him so severely, and when he finally got on to the Treasury bench he thought that the craven sycophants on the opposite side, if they said ”dank die Minister”, frequently enough would save him from facing the responsibilities of his high office.</p>, <p>He can stand on his own record.</p>, <p>The hon. Senator ought to be ashamed of himself!</p>, <p>I have not as yet heard of him standing on his own record at all. That is an interesting interjection, Mr. President—that the hon. the Minister should stand on his own record, on his own responsibility. That is exactly what we expect him to do in this House—to accept his responsibility and to stand up and defend it, not to run out of this House with all his sycophants yapping behind him. [Interjections.]</p>, <p>If the hon. the Minister is unable to accept the responsibilities of his office, if he has to rely on the protection of all the “ja-broers” opposite and if they are unable to protect him from the consequences of his office, then I believe he should accept the advice of my colleague, the hon. Senator Swanepoel, and make way for somebody who is prepared to accept the responsibilities of that office.</p>, <p>I would like to remind the hon. the Minister that second to the Prime Minister his is the most important office in the Government.</p>, <p>That is why he has that office.</p>, <p>He is responsible to the elected representatives of the people, to the taxpayers, to protect their interests, to protect the taxpayers and consumers, and to control in the best manner possible the use and expenditure of State funds.</p>, <p>And he is doing it very well.</p>, <p>All the evidence shows that he has illegally allowed millions to be used irregularly, and some of those millions to be used corruptly. Not only has he allowed this serious situation to arise but he has apparently sedulously avoided knowledge of this situation. Now he complains of personal vendettas being waged against him. Mr. President, these are not personal vendettas against him as a private individual. There is nothing personal against him as Owen Peter Faure Horwood. This is an effort to call him to account as the Minister of Finance of the Republic of South Africa.</p>, <p>The hon. Senator should look in the mirror.</p>, <p>The hon. the Minister has to accept responsibility for this portfolio and not abuse the privileges of this House and <i>de facto</i> admit culpability by refusing to face a debate.</p>, <p>Order! The hon. Senator must withdraw the expression “abuse the privileges of this House”.</p>, <p>Mr. President, I withdraw those words. I will say he used the rules of this House to the advantage of that side of the House. In so far as this House is concerned, this House was meant …</p>, <p>Mr. President, this side of the House did not contravene the rules of the House.</p>, <p>The hon. Senator did not say that the rules had been contravened but that they had been used to the advantage of that side of the House.</p>, <p>Mr. President, this hon. House was meant by the framers of the constitution to be the Upper House of the Parliament of South Africa where adult men and women, elected by the voters of the country to protect their interests, could face each other with courage and integrity, without fear or favour, and where the one side could criticize and attack and the other side could be called to account and to defend their actions before the bar of public opinion. Because of the action or lack of action on the part of hon. Senators on the Government side in this particular Information issue, this is what hon. Senators on this side of the House see as their duty to fulfil. The walk-out which took place the other day indicated that we have been doing that duty only too well. As I have already said, if the hon. the Minister of Finance is unable to face up to these attacks and this criticism in his capacity as Minister of Finance, not in his personal capacity as a man … .</p>, <p>Give me something to face up to.</p>, <p>I suggest to the hon. the Minister that he face up to these attacks and not walk out, Sir. And may I suggest that he cease to complain about vendettas and answer the issues as they are raised.</p>, <p>It is not I; it is everybody else. It is just a personal attack.</p>, <p>I believe, Mr. President, that this House should not be regarded as a comfortable club for kindly nonentities to chat amiably about the weather or to deal superficially with non-contentious political issues. Here we have to face the facts, face each other and do our duty to South Africa and to the people who have elected us.</p>, <p>When it comes to protecting the interests of the voters of South Africa there is another issue with which I would like to discuss with the hon. the Minister, one in which I believe he also has a responsibility although this is quite unrelated to the Information affair. This has been touched on by the hon. Senator Swanepoel and also by my colleague, the hon. Senator Bozas. The hon. the Minister has stated that he hopes for a 4% growth rate and has taken measures to stimulate the economy of South Africa to achieve that growth rate, measures which might in the short term be effective. However, only experience will show whether they have been effective or not. He has taken the steps of increasing the money supply and the provision of economic incentives. But I believe that we are entitled to ask the hon. the Minister what the longer term measures are which he has taken, measures which all authorities regard as being essential not only to maintain a 4% growth rate but to stimulate the economy so that the country will maintain a growth rate of 6% or more in order to meet the employment needs of our growing population, to combat socio-economic threats to the security of South Africa and to ensure that at least the economic security of South Africa will be maintained in the future.</p>, <p>I think all are agreed that in a modern economy, not only to sustain that economy but to ensure its growth, a situation in which there is a small group of educated, trained manpower with a large majority group, barely literate, a mass of them untrained or some of them at the best semi-trained, is most unlikely to be able to maintain the economic growth rate which, as I have said, all authorities regard as essential, particularly in a country such as ours.</p>, <p>This is the situation confronting us, a situation of a small group of educated, trained manpower with a mass of uneducated, largely illiterate and predominantly unskilled people. This is the situation we find after 30 years under this Government, the 30 years of which the hon. Senator Van Staden and the hon. Senator Dempsey are so proud. This situation has been highlighted by a report by the Chamber of Mines—from which I have taken extracts—business journals and the financial pages of the daily and week-end press carrying speeches by leaders of industry and commerce and paragraphs 5.6, 5.7 and 5.8 of Chapter V of the Wiehahn Commission report all of which emphasize the need to have a much more highly trained reserve of manpower to maintain economic growth in South Africa.</p>, <p>The hon. the Minister himself acknowledged and recognized this situation in his budget speech when he referred to the relatively small group of people who are unemployed among the Whites, Indians and Coloureds. By the same token it was made quite clear that the reserve of trained manpower to create and sustain this economic growth is minimal.</p>, <p>This situation is highlighted in the Chamber of Mines report to which I have referred. The Chamber’s human resources laboratory drew up a detailed analysis of the projected increase, so this is not the result of an <i>ad hoc</i> investigation; it is the result of an investigation by one of the most responsible and highly respected bodies in South Africa, one which controls what is probably the most important industry in South Africa, viz. the mining industry. When therefore one finds figures and opinions expressed by a research body appointed by the Chamber of Mines I believe it is incumbent on the hon. the Minister and on all South Africans to pay a great deal of attention to their findings and to their opinions. In an introductory paragraph the report says—</p>, <p>They go on to analyse the effect this will have on the mines, and they forecast in one particular respect—</p>, <p>That is only three years away from today or two years from the end of 1979. The hon. the Minister in his budget speech under the heading “Other Appropriations”—and I think it is important to mention here that he merely grouped the very important issue of education and training under “Other Appropriations”—had this to say—</p>, <p>I believe the very grouping which he made suggests a contradiction to his claim that education and training are receiving priority. But let us have a look at his Estimates of Expenditure from the State Revenue Account and we shall see whether his claim is justified.</p>, <p>The budgetary allocation for the Department of National Education—and this is for Whites only—has been increased for the ensuing year by approximately R27,75 million. So it does not quite keep pace with the current rate of inflation. It is less than the current rate of inflation of something over 12%. It is the responsibility of the Department of National Education to provide tertiary, technical and artisan training for the country and to develop to its maximum potential the White manpower reserves of South Africa. So far as vocational education is concerned, R9,5 million has been allocated for the ensuing year, which is slightly less than R5 million above the rate of inflation. I wonder whether this in fact is adequate. In passing may I point out to the hon. the Minister that the English translation of “beroepsonderwys” is “vocational training” and not “vocal training”, and I do hope that this carelessness is not an indication of his own carelessness in so far as his responsibilities are concerned.</p>, <p>A very petty remark.</p>, <p>I take it that is a purely objective statement.</p>, <p>That is a very objective statement; quite so, Mr. President. At least the hon. the Minister is taking it in a better spirit on this occasion. But whether it is personal or not, Mr. President, it still remains within the sphere of his responsibility as a Minister, but it should not be taken as a personal reflection on him as a man.</p>, <p>It is quite clear that we have virtually reached the ultimate in the potential manpower resources of the White group. We can go on through other allocations but so far as the White group is concerned, we have exploited virtually all the reserves of White trained manpower necessary to support the economy of South Africa. We have to look to the other groups for the potential to support a growth rate which we would all like to see and which should receive the priority the hon. the Minister claims it to have in his budget speech.</p>, <p>As far as Black education is concerned— and this is where the greatest potential lies— we find …</p>, <p>Order! Hon. Senators are conversing a trifle to loudly.</p>, <p>… that there has been an increase of R38 million in this appropriation for the ensuing year. This is plus-minus 15% over inflation which is a welcome increase. But, Mr. President, when this is related to a population group of over 20 million, it means that for that total population group we have an increase of less than R2 per head per annum. This brings the increase into some sort of perspective. We have an appropriation for vocational training for Black people of less than R1 million for 1979-’80, or to be more precise, R998 000. For Black teachers there is an extra R3,1 million above the R3,6 million of last year. [Time expired.]</p>, <p>Mr. President, I have listened to the sarcastic speech of the hon. Senator Henderson, a speech which emanates from his hatred of and vengeance towards the hon. the Minister of Finance. We are told that we won the 1977 election under false pretences because the irregularities in respect of <i>The Citizen</i> and <i>To The Point</i> were already taking place. I hope that the hon. Senator Henderson will listen to what I am about to say. The hon. the Prime Minister, Mr. Vorster, had served this country as Prime Minister for 13 years up to last year. He was tired as a result of the duties he had had to perform. His overseas trips and negotiations with other states had tired him out. [Interjections.] I do not need the sarcasm of the hon. Senator Henderson. That was the position. He was a tired man who had served us day and night. It was not solely due to Mr. Vorster that we won the 1977 election. We won it on the basis of principles, the principles of the NP. The achievements of the NP over the past 30 years instilled so much confidence in the English-speaking voters, the supporters of the NP and the supporters of the NRP and the supporters of the UP, that they voted National with the result that the NP won the election.</p>, <p>In view of the fact that the hon. Senator Henderson has been so hateful and sarcastic towards a fellow English-speaking person, why did his party not contest the Assembly by-elections in Nigel, Boksburg and Swellendam on the basis of stating one policy against another? Mr. Vorster had already disappeared from the scene as Prime Minister. Why did they not contest those parliamentary by-elections? What was the reason? They have no reply to that. Once again it was NP policy and not <i>The Citizen</i> or <i>To The Point</i> or Mr. Vorster who was the deciding factor. Hon. Senators of the Opposition were entitled to contest those seats on the basis of policies and principles, but they did not do so. The Opposition do not have a policy that they can offer the electorate but certain things are in their favour. There is the question of <i>The Citizen</i> and <i>To The Point</i>, the Information matter and the drought. All those things are in their favour but let us wait and see what the results will be of the by-elections on Thursday at Beaufort West and Swellendam where the two Opposition parties are opposing the NP. I want to tell the hon. Senator Henderson who spoke in such a sarcastic and sneering manner that that will be the real test We will test the hon. Senator Henderson against the results at Swellendam. I can already tell you what the results will be, Sir. The struggle there between the NRP and the PFP is really comical. Unimportant points are being exploited whilst policy matters are eschewed. Until a short while ago the NRP was still seeking rapprochement with the PFP but at the moment the NRP is as close to the policy and principles of the former UP as they can ever be. However, the electorate of Swellendam and Beaufort West have not forgotten the changes that the policy of the UP has undergone. In 1973 they spoke about White leadership. The electorate have not forgotten that But in 1976, Mr. Kowie Marais, Sir de Villiers Graaff, Mr. Colin Eglin and Mr. Theo Gerdener got together and accepted the 14 principles drawn up by Mr. Kowie Marais. But the electorate of Swellendam and Beaufort West will remember that the NRP and the PFP are so close together that the courtship will continue even after the election so that they can become even closer.</p>, <p>The hon. Senator Henderson will know on Thursday that truth has been triumphant. The NP won the election in 1977 on the basis of principles and policy and on Thursday the NP will win the two by-elections on the same basis. The hon. Senator Henderson will have to withdraw his words.</p>, <p>I am an Afrikaans-speaking member of this Parliament I am a member of many other Afrikaner organizations. I was waiting for someone to ask which Afrikaner organizations but nobody has asked me that. I as an</p>, <p>Afrikaans-speaking person and my colleagues here and in the Other Place have the highest regard for the hon. Senator Horwood as an English-speaking person.</p>, <p>So much so that you will accept him as a member of the Broederbond?</p>, <p>An hon. Senator has woken up, Sir. I do not think we shall be able to accept him as a member of either the Rapportryers or the Broederbond. I do not think that hon. Senator’s performance at Swellendam has been so good that we can recommend him. I do not think he will be able to claim membership of the Broederbond after Thursday. Sir, I cannot understand the sharp attack by hon. Senators on that side of the House on the hon. Senator Horwood. I simply cannot understand it because I as an Afrikaans-speaking person have already taken a back seat in constituencies so that English-speaking people could get the benefit. I can prove that, Sir. I have taken a back seat at the highest level. The Opposition parties ask themselves so many “why’s” Sir. The one “why” they are still asking themselves, is why they got such a shock in 1948. They simply cannot recover from that shock. Even after 30 years they have still not recovered. It was pathetic to witness the division within their ranks. It was so pathetic to see them searching assiduously for the reasons why they were losing one election after the other. But as long as the Opposition advocate a policy of an integrated franchise and a common voters’ roll they will continue to lose one election after the other, as happened in the case of the UP. However, they have learnt a lesson from the NP, and they are now advocating separate voters’ rolls. As far as group areas are concerned, they state very clearly that their policy is that people should be free to live where they want to live. In other words, all races can live in certain residential areas. That is also the policy of the PFP. But which schools will the children attend? Will they attend the school nearest to them? Must the children attend the nearest school to which all races will claim admission? The hon. Senator Bozas gesticulates; that is the trouble with that double-barrelled party, Sir. That is another form of integration they are advocating. As long as they advocate a policy of integration as against our policy of separation, they will never make any progress as an Opposition.</p>, <p>What does the labour market look like after the Wiehahn Commission report?</p>, <p>I think the hon. Senator Swanepoel ought to know better than to ask such a question. In terms of the Wiehahn Commission report people are not going to live together. Our people have forgotten that during the years prior to 1948 South Africa lost billions of rands because the policy of the former UP was to establish as few industries as possible in South Africa and to tap the resources of the country in order to supply mother England.</p>, <p>Oh, please!</p>, <p>That is true, hon. Senator Oelrich. We know that is true. Just think of the large number of industries we have today, Hon. Senators know that we lost millions of rands during the years when the UP was in power. We do not know today what the value was of the goods that were sent to mother England prior to 1948, but it ran into billions of pounds which was the currency at that time, not rands. However, we are not so short-sighted. If the goods were sent to keep them dive and to assist them in building up and re-establishing their industries after the war, we are not so short-sighted as to make the personal attacks on them as they have been making on the hon. Senator Horwood.</p>, <p>During the war years Gen. Smuts promised that the agriculturists, especially the maize producers, would be paid the difference between the price they received and what they should have received. Was that promise ever honoured? Never. It was never honoured. But today the Opposition tries to confuse the electorate in Swellendam and Beaufort West and to get them to exploit the question of agricultural prices whilst it is due to the drought that a large section of the Western Cape, the Eastern Cape and other parts of the country are in the parlous state in which they are. If NP propaganda is of such a nature as alleged by the Opposition why don’t they make any progress whenever we state our policy, our agricultural policy or whichever policy it may be that underlies our principles? Can the hon. Senator Oelrich tell me why they are not making any progress? Why not? Answer me.</p>, <p>Famous last words. Wait a minute.</p>, <p>The hon. Senator will see for himself, and I concede it, that his party will be second tomorrow and the PFP will be third. The PFP candidate will lose his deposit. If the voters of Swellendam vote the NRP into second place tomorrow, they will only have been voting for a grandchild of the PFP. [Interjections.]</p>, <p>Reference has been made to Mr. Kowie Marais. He is a member of the PFP with which hon. Senators want to co-operate. Sir de Villiers Graaff, for whom we have great respect, has also disappeared. Mr. Theo Gerdener who lost his deposit at the Bellville by-election and whom they also supported, has also disappeared. The only remaining one is Mr. Colin Eglin.</p>, <p>He has almost disappeared.</p>, <p>It is pathetic to witness the decline of the Opposition, Sir. The NRP have ten seats in the House of Assembly and the PFP have only 17. That performance is pathetic against the background of this old NP propaganda as the hon. Senator Oelrich called it. Only Mr. Colin Eglin remains. It is pathetic to see, Sir.</p>, <p>I am sorry that the hon. Senator Winchester is not here. In Groote Schuur and the so-called UP constituencies Mr. Colin Eglin and his party, with whom the NRP was so anxious to co-operate prior to the election, threw seven and later eight of those 14 principles overboard. They did so in order to mislead the electorate. I repeat that they will not succeed in misleading the electorate at the two by-elections tomorrow. They will definitely not succeed in doing that even though they subscribe to only six of those principles. That has been the result of the ambiguous attitude of the two Opposition parties. We at least are honest, Sir. What is done, is done. The hon. Senator Van Staden also referred to that a moment ago. What is done, is done and we shall rectify what needs to be rectified. An HON. SENATOR: What will be, will be.</p>, <p>This ambiguous talk of the UP …</p>, <p>Which Party?</p>, <p>The NRP. The hon. Senator asks which party. I would say the UP. After all, the NRP is only a resurrected version of the old UP. [Interjections.] The hon. Senator Moll knows where he said that Today the hon. Senator asks quite sanctimoniously “What is the UP?”</p>, <p>He has heard something but he does not know the rights of it.</p>, <p>Sir, I know very well what the rights are. I worked there and I know that everything the NRP did there has been undone. This NRP …</p>, <p>Hit them, Jan, hit them!</p>, <p>… refrained from formulating a policy in respect of the survival of the two Houses of this Parliament. They did not try to say anything about that. All they did was to raise unimportant matters. They spoke about certain medicines that the aged could no longer obtain, of health services and provincial services that were not available, and so forth. That is downright misleading. However, what they did not tell the electorate of Swellendam and which they will continue not to tell them—not as a party but as part of their policy—is that should the PFP come into power it will very soon, in terms of its policy, establish a Black majority government in South Africa. As an off-spring of the PFP they are merely moving a little slower. The child must first crawl before it can walk. The NRP and the PFP—the names have changed so often in the past—should learn one lesson this afternoon, and also in respect of the by-election tomorrow and the other one that we will have at Randfontein and the other by-elections. Since 1948 they have continually leaned towards the liberal left where they are welcomed with open arms. [Interjections.]</p>, <p>Yes, hon. Senator knows about it. The old UP rejected the conservative representatives and electorate on Opposition side on every occasion. When we and the Opposition have to talk positively, they are free to criticize us. However, this NP Government has done a great deal during the 30 years it has been in power. It has done positive things such as improving health services for Whites and non-Whites. It has created work opportunities. Sir, the NP has done a great deal to expand the international sea-routes around the Cape. Nothing is said about the good we did when the Suez Canal was closed in 1967 with the result that ships had to round the Cape. From then on up to 1975 the international world took advantage of South Africa’s kindness.</p>, <p>Sir, why does the Opposition not try to build on our achievements as indicated in the information documents of the Department of Information? The actual facts are disclosed there. For example, it states whether a project has been undertaken by the Department of Water Affairs or whatever the department may be.</p>, <p>Can we believe that?</p>, <p>Sir, I waited for that; that is the kind of thing that hurts. The type of remark that the hon. Senator Webber has just made, is the type of remark that harms this country. These Information documents are circulated overseas. We send people overseas armed with this information. And now someone asks in this Upper House: “Can we believe that?” What must our friends and also our enemies overseas …</p>, <p>Do you believe Connie?</p>, <p>Sir, the foundations of the Opposition were built on sand. This is the Opposition that will be beaten tomorrow and in the future.</p>, <p>Everything that happened in the defunct Department of Information perhaps happened at the right time. Perhaps that will inspire the NP not simply to govern this country for a further 30 years but to serve South Africa for an even longer period. *Senator J. L. HORAK: Mr. President, prior to the speech of the hon. Senator who has just resumed his seat, I was under the happy illusion that the House was discussing the motion of the hon. the Minister that the House go into Committee on the Estimate of Expenditure for the year 1979-’80. Apparently I was wrong. This afternoon the hon. Senator has made of this House a platform at Gansbaai, Malagas or Baardskeerderspos because the hon. Senator has brought the wrong notes with him. He has used the notes in this House that he was probably going to use this evening at Baardskeerdersbos or Gansbaai. Sir, you will, therefore, forgive me if I do not elaborate on the speech of that hon. Senator.</p>, <p>I just want to say that I admire the hon. gentleman as an old-fashioned politician. He is a brilliant exponent of the old “boere-verneuk”-politics that Tielman Roos used to refer to and which were so popular in South Africa at that time. There is an Institute of Contemporary History at the University of the Orange Free State, Bloemfontein. I am very tempted to suggest to the hon. Senator Dippenaar that he presents himself at that Institute as a fine and living example of old-fashioned politics.</p>, <p>What about Senator Van Staden?</p>, <p>I cannot follow the arguments of the hon. Senator. He had a great deal to say, of course, about the expected results at Swellendam and Beaufort West and said that we should wait until Thursday. I think, however, that he was wrong; it will probably only be Friday. He told us that we would realize on Thursday how solidly the people were behind the NP. We shall wait and see what happens.</p>, <p>I do not know whether the hon. Senator knows this but in Natal there is a constituency called South Coast. Until a short while ago that constituency was represented in the Natal Provincial Council by a member of the NP but unfortunately he died. There is a vacancy in that constituency which was previously held by the NP. I can tell the hon. Senator that I am not really a betting man, but if he were to have a chat with me in the Lobby we could discuss the South Coast constituency. We can make forecasts. I predict that that constituency will be taken by the NRP.</p>, <p>[Interjections.] What does that prove, Mr. President? What do the stories about Beaufort West and Swellendam prove? Traditionally they are NP constituencies. But South Coast, however, is a constituency that was won by the NP in the last election and what is going to happen? I predict that that constituency will be taken by the NRP on 4 July. [Interjections.] <i>The Citizen</i> and <i>To The Point?</i> Yes, of course.</p>, <p>Order! We are anxious to listen further to this important economic exposition.</p>, <p>†Senator J. L. HORAK: Thank you, Mr. President I was just about to come to the economic situation. However, I hope that hon. Senators will continue to listen with as much care to my political nonsense as they have been listening. You must however forgive my political nonsense, Mr. President, because I had to reply to some political nonsense. I am sure that the Institute for Contemporary History at the University of the Free State will welcome the presence of the hon. Senator Dippenaar as a living example of the old type of politician.</p>, <p>Really, you are most afraid of such people.</p>, <p>Sir, let me return to the Budget before I get back into the scrum, which I intend to do presently. The Budget has made very considerable tax concessions amounting to something like R617 million. One obviously welcomes these concessions. After all, only two things are certain in this life and they are death and taxes, so it is at least fairly certain that any remission of taxes will be welcomed by the unfortunate people who have to pay. Naturally, we welcome these remissions.</p>, <p>In announcing these remissions, the hon. the Minister said that his Budget contains elements of structural tax reform. That is true, Sir. He specifically mentions the lowering of the income tax scales and the decrease of the rates of diminution of abatements and the increase of those abatements themselves. He mentions those as examples of the concessions which these proposals contain. All that is perfectly true. However, when everything is said and done there is one fundamental element of the direct taxation system, as applied, which remains unchanged in principle. That element is the additional tax burden imposed upon the higher income earners, as compared to that of people in the lower income groups. In other words, the more one earns, the greater percentage of one’s income is paid in direct taxation. That is inherent in the system and the hon. the Minister’s structural reforms have done nothing about that. To put it rather simplistically, the system lays a penalty on success. Surely, it is the successful men and women in this free enterprise society who are the mainsprings of economic growth and development. They are the people who occupy positions in which they are managers, entrepreneurs and skilled professional people. They are the mainsprings of economic development in any free enterprise society. Sir, any damper placed upon the initiative of these people—specifically in the form of a tax impost which increases at a higher tempo for every additional R1 000 earned—is a disincentive. Thus the economy must suffer in terms of input, productivity, skills and planning.</p>, <p>In terms of these proposals, a married man who earns R500 per month, pays 9,5% of his income in income tax. If by his endeavour, proficiency and excellence, he increases his earnings to R1 000 per month, he does not pay 9,5% any more but 14,2% in income tax. Sir, I regard that as penalizing success. This is inherent in the system and the hon. the Minister’s structural reforms have not touched that aspect of the matter to any appreciable extent. I want to be fair and say that I accept the fact that the hon. the Minister has reduced the marginal rate of taxation, but the principle has not been affected at all. I would therefore make an earnest appeal to the hon. the Minister to re-examine this whole situation because the present system seems to me to be in conflict with a basic concept of the free enterprise society. I think it provides a disincentive, in fact, to the optimum operation of the free enterprise system.</p>, <p>Of course, Sir, there are other contradictions inherent in our present system that I will refer to briefly. Let us look at the position of the married woman who earns money. The hon. the Minister has again made a concession this year whereby R900 per annum of a married woman’s earnings shall be free of tax; in other words, R75 per month—a totally insignificant sum. It is an improvement, admittedly, and I suppose we must be grateful for small mercies. But R75 per month as the maximum of a married woman’s earnings which will be free of tax is to my mind totally inadequate. A highly qualified professional woman who happens to be a specialized radiologist and is married to an equally successful professional man, said to me the other day: “I like to work and there is a tremendous shortage of people in my sphere of work, but I cannot afford it because my income and my husband’s income go together, except for R900, for taxation purposes. I must therefore either stop working or I must divorce my husband and live with him in sin. Those are the alternatives I have. We cannot continue to pay tax at this level.” I maintain therefore that the R900 is totally inadequate. And yet we are trying to encourage married women who are skilled and trained to continue working because of the manpower position to which my colleague, the hon. Senator Henderson, referred. Surely, Sir, it is not the policy of the Government to dissuade married women to stop working when they can contribute to the economy, or to encourage them to live immorally? Surely that is not the policy of this Government? I do not believe it, even of this Government!</p>, <p>Koot Vorster.</p>, <p>And this is in direct conflict, strangely enough, with the policy that is applied in regard to social pensions. A woman who reaches the age of 65 who is drawing the old-age pension and is working, is encouraged to continue to work, and she is paid the maximum old age pension regardless of what she is earning from her employment. So on the one hand one is encouraging old ladies to continue working because there is a shortage of manpower or womanpower and on the other hand one is saying to the professionally trained younger woman who can earn R10 000, R15 000 or R20 000 a year and contribute to the economy: “My girl, if you want to continue working you and your husband must pay.” That, Sir is a contradiction in the system and I simply cannot understand it. It would be, I think, a relatively simple thing to tax married women who are in full employment separately from their husbands. Surely the money could be recovered somewhere else. And we would, I think, gain more on the swings than we would lose on the roundabouts by keeping specialized, proficient women in employment. Talking about people living together immorally to avoid paying tax, I will never forget a former Minister of Finance, the late Dr. Dönges, changing the maintenance system which divorced men were subject to in terms of tax. Before 1961, if a man divorced his wife, for good reasons, or she divorced him for good reasons, and he paid maintenance, that maintenance was taxable in the hands of the recipient; in other words, in the hands of the wife. Before 1961, if a husband paid R300 a month maintenance to a divorced wife, that money was taxable in the hands of the wife at a fairly low level. The late Dr. Dönges, whom I knew very well and for whom I had much respect, said quite happily in the Other Place: “I want to discourage divorce”—and he said this very much with his tongue in his cheek, Mr. President—“so in future the maintenance will be taxable in the hands of the husband and not in the hands of the recipient, of the divorced wife.” This meant of course that that maintenance was taxable at a tremendously high rate, probably, 9%, 10% or 11%, whereas in the hands of the recipient it was taxable at a very low rate. That was a very clever manoeuvre but I do not for one moment believe that it had anything to do with discouraging divorce.</p>, <p>There is another point of conflict, Sir. I note with great regret that the hon. the Minister has done nothing in this budget about the excise duty on beer. The young people of today when they play a game of tennis, squash or rugby cannot afford to drink beer. So what do they drink? They drink vodka and add Coke or Pepsi to it, because with the best will in the world one cannot quench one’s thirst by drinking wine after a game of rugby. It would practically kill one, I should think. Of course, I have very little experience of these things, very little indeed! So whereas we have it as the declared sociological policy on the part of the Government to change the pattern of drinking so that people will drink less spirits and more natural wines and beer, the hon. the Minister’s excise policy in respect of beer is in direct conflict with that sociological policy. I will give the hon. the Minister this credit— and he gets very little credit these days, deservedly so, I regret to say—that he did not institute this system. It was again a previous Minister of Finance who said, I thought very cynically, in the Other Place: “Well, I have decided to increase the excise duty on beer because people drink a lot of beer.” Well, I suppose people now drink a little less beer, I do not know. But I do know that among the younger people in South Africa today there is a tendency that gives me cause for much concern and that is to drink not beer, after having taken exercise, but hard spirits, usually white spirits, with mixers like Coca-Cola and that sort of thing. I am not talking about my own children, Sir. They are grown-up and are qualified etc. But I see this among the younger people. I say again this is a conflict inherent in the system.</p>, <p>So I want to suggest to the hon. the Minister that he look at all these things— beer, maintenance in divorces, although that is a minor one—but particularly at these two things. Firstly, at the earnings of married women because we are depriving ourselves by this system of the services of professionally trained and qualified married women while we have a tremendous shortage of manpower or womanpower; and secondly, Sir, at the basic fact that a man now pays an increasingly high income tax commensurate with what he earns. The more one earns not the more one pays but the more and more one pays! I think the hon. the Minister must try to level that out.</p>, <p>The hon. Senator is hitting at the progressive thing?</p>, <p>Yes, I am hitting at the progressive thing. I think the hon. the Minister must even look at the possibility of a flat rate throughout, because, Sir, this system penalizes efficiency and hampers productivity in enterprise.</p>, <p>The farmers agree with you.</p>, <p>Yes, I am sure they do.</p>, <p>Mr. President, I suppose it would be impossible in a budget debate not to refer to the Information affair. It would be like writing a leading article on the Panama Canal when the Jameson Raid took place—something which actually happened. A certain Dr. Engelenburg who was editor of <i>Die Volkstem</i> in those days, went away on a few days leave, but before leaving he wrote some leading articles and left them with his assistant editor. When he came back he was horrified to find that on the day after the Jameson Raid <i>Die Volkstem</i> had carried a leading article on the Panama Canal!</p>, <p>That sounds like the NRP.</p>, <p>As I say, Mr. President, if I were to sit down now without talking about the Information situation, I would be writing a leading article on the Panama Canal. But, I am sorry to say that this whole business makes me very nearly physically ill. I take no pleasure in talking about it but as a matter of duty I must. I must say that in my view the responsibility lies fairly and squarely upon the shoulders of the NP Government. There is no question about it. I try to be a fair-minded man and that is where I feel the responsibility lies. As I have said before in this House, it goes back to the appointment of Dr. Eschel Rhoodie by the Cabinet over the recommendation of the Public Service Commission. It was an overriding of the Public Service Commission recommendation when Dr. Eschel Rhoodie was appointed over the head of Piet Weidemann. Piet Weidemann happened to be a good friend of mine. He was never anything but a good Nationalist but he was also a good public servant. The Cabinet of the day in its wisdom decided to override the recommendation of the Public Service Commission and Rhoodie was appointed. That was the beginning of a story which has caused South Africa untold harm in terms of our image, our reputation and our integrity in the outside world. It has caused South Africa untold damage in terms of the morale of the people—“die volks-moreel”; and it has been a terrible thing, an absolutely terrible thing.</p>, <p>I am not greatly concerned about the responsibility of individuals. It is not in my nature to look for individuals to blame. I believe in the principle of joint Government responsibility, and I believe that this</p>, <p>Government must take the responsibility for what happened over this whole sorry, sick saga. I want to say this, though the hon. Senator Dippenaar is not here now, that I think he will find in the election results in this country an expression of rejection.</p>, <p>Careful, careful!</p>, <p>No, I am being careful, and I do not need the hon. Senator Dempsey to tell me when to be careful and when not. I have been here long enough to know when I must be careful. I say that we will find a reflection of that in the election results in this country, including South Coast, which to my mind will be an excellent example of the operation of the democratic process.</p>, <p>You know, Sir, if I were a NP Senator and my Party improved its position at Swellendam or Beaufort West, I would be very worried because I would begin to think that there was something wrong with the national conscience. I would be very worried indeed. However, let us leave that to the hon. gentlemen and let them interpret the results as they come in their own way. I simply want to say, Sir, that after all these months, the Government and the country are still wallowing in this mudpool. As I have said, the sight of this thing makes me physically ill. I also want to say that until this thing is cleared up and cleared up finally and totally, we will walk, all of us in this country, Sir, with the millstone of this thing hanging round our necks. I am a proud South African; I go overseas and I defend my country to the best of my poor ability and I do not like this sort of thing. I think it is terrible and I want to appeal to everybody concerned, for God’s sake, let us clear this thing up and let us get to the bottom of it; let us cut out the cancer and let us go forward. Those who must suffer and those who must pay penalties, must pay those penalties, but South Africa itself cannot continue to pay this dreadful penalty which is like a running ulcer, an uncured, running ulcer.</p>, <p>What do you want us to do? Do you want the Minister to resign? Is that your solution?</p>, <p>If that will help to do it, I say he should resign.</p>, <p>Sir, I am saying no more and no less than that this thing must be cleared up because South Africa and the people of South Africa cannot afford to go on in this way, and I think that the Government has had enough time now to clear it up and that they must get moving. In the name of heaven let us fix this thing and let us go forward.</p>, <p>Mr. President, it is a long time since I envied the NRP anything but if there is something I envy them I must say it is the hon. Senator Horak. Perhaps it ill-behoves me as a NP Senator to congratulate him on his speech, but the first part of his speech, particularly in regard to taxation I thought was first-class, and more particularly, in regard to the taxation of married women. Compared with the hon. Senator Henderson he handled the second part of his speech with great delicacy and I think we all admit that he had a point, except for one thing: We are aware of where we went wrong. But I am not a masochist and neither is my party. Beating the breast, wringing the hands and wailing at the wall will not put anything right. We are doing what will put it right.</p>, <p>One would think that the commission had finished its work that everything was over and that judgment had been passed from the way these hon. Senators talk. It has not yet finished its work and judgment has not yet been passed.</p>, <p>The hon. Senator Horak mentioned that he had always been very careful. Perhaps that was a mistake. Had he not been so careful perhaps he would have been sitting, like his ertswhile colleague the Minister of Community Development, in the NP Cabinet today. I have a funny feeling that he would be more at home there. [Interjections.] I am sorry to have to kill him with my praise!</p>, <p>On a personal level, Sir, I have always found the hon. Senator Henderson charming but I must say: “Beware the Greeks bearing gifts.” However, I was fairly shattered today to hear the political and personal venom that fell from his lips. Perhaps the only excuse could be that he is a Senator from Natal. The hon. the Minister of Finance also comes from Natal. He was highly thought of by the people of Natal. He was the rector of Natal University. He was not elected to that position by the NP Government; he was chosen by the people of Natal to be the rector of their university. He also comes from an outstanding family. At one stage his grandfather was secretary to John X. Merriman. I think I am correct in saying that. He is the grandson of Sir Pieter Faure who served in Rhodes’ Cabinet. In fact, he was just the type for the good old colonial United Party and what a bitter blow when he left them! I think it is laughable to accuse a man who became a member of the NP in the Province of Natal of cowardice. I know Natal, and I can tell you, Sir, …</p>, <p>Not very well, obviously.</p>, <p>I know it quite well enough. I also know the English from that part of the world quite well enough. I can tell you, Sir, that he showed remarkable courage. Although it was very kind of the hon. Senator Henderson to praise my father and the late Minister Trollip by saying that they would never have run away, more or less implying that they were a finer breed, he should perhaps think back to a remark like: “Who would follow a Trollip?” and the reply: “Only a Horwood”!</p>, <p>I can remember the personal suffering to which my own family was subjected. I remember the bitter attacks that were made by certain sections of the UP against my family. My sister was at Redean at the time. I can remember the priest in the Communion class at Redean comparing Judas with those who had betrayed Strauss. I also remember an article in the <i>Rand Daily Mail</i> which stated: “Frank Waring voted with the Government on the Coloured question” and, next to that, another article stating: “Frank Waring appointed to the Maize Board.” I am sure hon. Senators will see the implication that that was his little gift for having voted with the Government. No mention was made of the fact that he had been on the Maize Board for about 15 years. So don’t let us be too pious and make out that Minister Horwood is the nigger in the woodpile and that the other men in the past were heroes. Believe me, Sir, members of the Opposition hated them prob ably more than they hate the hon. the Minister of Finance. Fortunately, the dogs bark but the caravan passes. I think they are making a mistake.</p>, <p>I have lots of papers here. You would be surprised to know that the telegrams I have here, come from people of great stature in the business world—not supporters of the National Party by any manner of means— congratulating the man you are attacking, on his budget and on the personal stand he has taken in this country. However, I thought what could be better than to quote from a magazine entitled <i>Management</i> which won the Afrox award for industrial reporting. I am sure that Afrox is not a subsidiary of the National Party.</p>, <p>Anglo American.</p>, <p>That is right. Anglo American. I will not go into those papers. I do not have time to read everything they say about the Minister, but, amongst other things, they say the following—</p>, <p>He is not that cowardly, lying scoundrel that you are trying to make him. I quote further—</p>, <p>May I say something to hon. Senators? Before I had personal knowledge of the hon. Senator Horwood I was told in Paarl that he had the highest I.Q. they have ever had at Paarl Boys’ High School, and many great men have been to that school. I quote further—</p>, <p>I want to ask hon. Senators, do they think that these things should be overlooked for wild statements and unproven scandal-mongering? Or are you doing it because you see there a man who has won Natal …</p>, <p>That is the point.</p>, <p>… from you, who has wrested it from your grasp? Here hon. Senators sit, men who have failed to hold their seats, and here he sits, having won the province that at one stage people were talking of giving back. Douglas Mitchell was talking of opting out of Union. I think that is what has made you so bitter. When I say this, I am talking about many of the NRP members on that side. I exclude one or two. [Interjections.] I can only say that last remark is what I expect from that hon. Senator.</p>, <p>The hon. Senator Henderson also spoke in scathing terms of the “jabroers” who supported the Minister. I can tell you, I have been in the National Party for a long time. I joined it before my parents. I want to say that that is one of the things that has held this country and this party together—<i>ex unitate vires.</i> We do not do what you have done to your leaders. When my father and his friends attacked Strauss to his face in the caucus they were thrown out of the party. It was not much later that he was stabbed in the back and told that he had to resign because of his ill-health—ill-health while he was skiing in Switzerland! We know what they did to Sir De Villiers Graaff and I say “we” because I still think most of them, had they been younger, would have been in the PFP. We know what they are going to do to Colin Eglin. I say to hon. Senators opposite therefore that this loyalty is not to be sneered at, believe me.</p>, <p>I wanted to speak mainly on something that, in my view, is very important to all of us, men and women here, and that is the position of women in the economy of this country today. I think it is important that we should realize that the women who fight for women’s rights are not freakish, they are not doing it for personal glory. Perhaps I should quote the testimony that was given before Lord Ashley’s commission of inquiry into the labour conditions in the British coal mines in the 19th century—</p>, <p>Mr. President, I am trying to show that women have fought for their rights and the rights of their children because they had to fight for them. In 18th century England there were only two careers open to good women. One was domestic service and the other was governessing. For bad women there was the choice of being an actress or a prostitute. The good women had no choice. If their fathers could no longer afford to keep them, perhaps because of droughts on their farms, they had to send their daughters out to work. If the women were not educated, all that they could do was domestic service, and this was pretty terrible at the time, not always but often.</p>, <p>As recently as 1842 a law was passed forbidding women to go underground. That is not much longer than 100 years ago. In 1847 the ten-hour day was passed for women and children. Few men would work a ten-hour day. Women today were freed in 1867 with the advent of the typewriter. Today we are fighting again, and I want to tell you, Sir, that we have had considerable success. Here I must also say thank you to the Government of the day which I hope will carry on with the work it has been doing in this regard. We have had success both in regard to the divorce laws and, I hope, in regard to marriage laws. Women are being protected and are being recognized not as chattels of their husbands but as people in their own right. But there are still things that we want and things we feel justified in wanting, not because we are being difficult or because we want to leave our homes and our families but because more and more women are going on to the labour market.</p>, <p>Thirty-five per cent of married women work, and I presume 99% of unmarried women. But we find it very difficult to work because, for instance, our income tax is such that it forces us to have to be really dedicated to want to work. And with that 35% of married women who work and who suffer because of income tax, go their husbands. Even if the position in regard to income tax for married women remains unchanged, which seems to be the position at the moment, there are certain benefits we should like to ask for.</p>, <p>A letter has been written to me by the women doctors at the big hospital in the Tygervallei, the Tygerberg Hospital. They tell me that there are certain floors there which cannot run if the women doctors do not work. They explain that they have to pay for their own cars; they get no rebate on their income tax. They also have to pay for their telephones. Their housekeeping has to be done and, because they are working, they have to pay a woman to run their homes. I think we will all agree that if a woman is a doctor and her services are needed so badly that floors cannot run unless she works, it is no good saying that she should go back to looking after her family in which case she would not have these problems.</p>, <p>They have also asked me to speak to members in both Houses about providing crèches for working women. We cannot wish away 35% of our married women. Some of them have to work; some of them we need to work. They ask me to see if we cannot provide well-run Government crèches for which they are quite willing to pay. They also say that schools are used only in the mornings and they want to know why they cannot be used in the afternoons so that the children can stay there, play sport and do their homework. This would leave a considerable number of women free to help with the country’s economy.</p>, <p>I should like to read out two things, one of which, a recent statement by Major-General Neil Webster, neatly summarizes the situation that I have discussed—</p>, <p>I also want to quote the following—</p>, <p>I think therefore that hon. Senators will agree that it is in the interests of all of us that it be made possible for more women to work.</p>, <p>At the beginning of this century women in England agitated for the vote. They threw themselves in front of horses and chained themselves to railings but the men did not give them the vote. But what they did during the 1914-’18 war in the factories for the British war effort made the men ashamed that they had kept the vote away from them. They gave them the vote shortly after the war was over. Our South African men have in many ways really been in the forefront of looking after their women. Perhaps they remembered those women of Natal who forced their husbands to trek on into Natal and said they would climb barefoot over the mountains; but they had to go on. South African men have looked after their women. My appeal is this: Please, before it is too late, make it possible for us to work now so that when we are needed we can fill the position quickly and efficiently.</p>, <p>I gather that the Women’s Legal Status Committee achieved great status among some of the men who sat on the Wiehahn Commission. They said they were astounded at the quality of those women. The representatives of that committee said, <i>inter alia</i>—</p>, <p>They also ask that—</p>]')
